Salesforce’s stock plunged on Dec 2, 2020 by 8.9% despite the announcement of positive income growth. Investors are mainly worried about the hefty price tag of $27.7B for Slack, which represents a 54% premium to its unaffected price or 26x forward sales. Having made as many as 60 acquisitions over the years, six of which occurred in 2019, investors are wary of Salesforce’s over-reliance on acquisition for growth. This is coupled with the fact that Slack has been underperforming its cloud peers during this work-from-home shift. For instance, Zoom’s Q3 revenue grew 365% while Slack’s grew a mere 39%. Video chat in Slack remains more basic than what rival Zoom has offered, limited to calls within an organization instead of letting a wider network of users jump on a virtual meeting.', '', '', 'Long-term outlook', '', 'Due to the lockdowns resulting from COVID-19, companies were forced to rapidly adapt overnight to be able to communicate remotely across all levels of a firm. During the pandemic, many companies were forced to move towards remote work operations. Using unified communication software, such as Slack and Microsoft Teams, firms adapted and found convenient ways to stay connected and on top of their business operations even when distantly separated. Aspects of remote work are likely to persist to a certain degree post-pandemic due to the convenience of messaging tools, as a survey conducted by RBC Capital Markets has shown that more than 40% of workers found workplace messaging tools as “absolutely critical” after COVID-19. Therefore, Salesforce’s long-term offering as an all-encompassing CRM provider will be significantly strengthened by their acquisition of Slack.

This move by Salesforce poses a great threat to Microsoft as Slack's usage hits the heart of Microsoft's most central products of its productivity suite, Microsoft Teams. In turn, Slack’s acquisition will not only generate long-run revenue synergies for the company but also help Salesforce better compete with its major rival Microsoft."", '', 'Another benefit that the consolidation brings is that Slack can help Salesforce bring traction to other CRM products. Previously, Microsoft has used its Teams software to cross-promote other Office 365 products. Similarly, Salesforce can integrate Slack with its other softwares to create a more complete productivity suite for its users. This way, the company can cross-sell or upsell its existing cloud service products, which contributes to the company’s consistent goal of 25% year-on-year growth in revenue. ', ' ', 'The acquisition of Slack contributes to the trend of M&A in the cloud software industry. With the acquisitions of Slack in 2020, Tableau in 2019, and MuleSoft in 2018, Salesforce’s CEO Marc Benioff is attempting to transform the company into a “one-stop shop” for all business operations related to sales and marketing. Ultimately, buying Slack may prompt Salesforce to acquire other online collaborative products to complement Slack, such as Dropbox for better document management and RingCentral for better video conferencing. Moreover, the trend of acquisition in the industry will continue as other SaaS companies like SAP and Oracle may be urged to conduct more M&As so they can better compete and keep up with the trend in the industry.', ' ', '', 'Figure 6: Salesforce’s Major Acquisition Timeline (2016-2020)', '', 'Risks and Uncertainties', '', ""As far as internal uncertainties go, the board of directors of both companies have approved the transaction with the Slack board recommending that Slack stakeholders approve the transaction and adopt the merger agreement. However, UBS analysts argue that with Salesforce's massive value and size that development to Slack’s software would not be given proper attention, noting that they are “less and less clear about the direction that Salesforce is heading”. With the short term of the acquisition geared towards linking Slack into the Salesforce portfolio, some things that customers are looking forward to in the near future may not come to fruition, which could severely impact Slack’s performance. "", '', 'On the other hand, Slack could be a distraction for Salesforce management and could therefore not be believed to be the best owner for Slack. A much better suited one could argue could be Google or Amazon as they could integrate Slack into their platforms, but that would be unlikely due to antitrust regulations. Furthermore, Slack’s growth should be a risk for Salesforce. They have not turned a profit since their initial public offering last year. Since Slack is a SaaS valued at multiples of revenue instead of profits, their growth forecast faces immense pressure on its ability to materialize as earnings. This is concerning for Salesforce, who would be giving up nearly 13% of their market value for the acquisition based on Slack’s EV/Sales multiple seen in Figure 2.  Further, if Salesforce were to affect Slack’s internal operations through the acquisition, some existing customers may be turned away, as many customers now enjoy Slack for their simplicity and neutrality. Given the risks of the deal and Salesforce’s valuation of over $200 billion, analysts have suggested that their investors root for an antitrust review to prevent the deal.', '', 'Naturally, any deal of this size is subject to antitrust speculation. An antitrust debate has arisen after Slack has said that they cannot compete without a “defensive acquisition” despite saying they wanted to stay independent. This brings about a larger issue regarding a power disparity revolving mostly around Big Tech. Nonetheless, Salesforce is expected to be successful in its acquisition of Slack. It remains to be seen whether Slack will stay an independent entity after the acquisition as Salesforce has rebranded both Demandware and ExactTarget as Salesforce Commerce Cloud and Marketing Cloud respectively, yet allowed Tableau, MuleSoft, and Quip to keep their branding.

In 2019, Spotify decided to double down in the podcast industry, with the acquisitions of Parcast and Anchor FM, to expand Spotify’s library of podcast offerings.', '', 'In 2020 February, Spotify acquired The Ringer, a sports & pop culture podcast network, to continue expanding its product offerings and make these podcasts only available on Spotify.

By 2016, Spotify had conquered six unique country markets in Asia, despite the idiosyncrasy of each one.

Finally, key businesses and some central functions of the combined group will be based in Milan and Rome and the leadership of the group finance function will be located in Milan."", '', '', 'Short-term outlook', '', ""From LSE's side, this deal will bring them one step closer to winning approval for its highly anticipated purchase of Refinitiv for $27B. Refinitiv is a data provider, 45% owned by the parent company of Reuters News, Thomas Reuters Corp. The reason for the divestment of Borsa was to ease the concerns the European Commission has over LSE controlling the European bond market; there has been significant regulatory scrutiny over the proposed deal with Refinitiv. In fact, the transaction's completion depends upon European authorities allowing for the Refinitiv acquisition to go through. LSE has said they would have preferred to keep their Italian arm, but are reassured from the sale given they will make a considerable profit; the 2007 purchase of Borsa was for €1.6B. "", '', ' ""We believe the sale of the Borsa Italiana group will contribute significantly to addressing the EU\'s competition concerns.” ', ""said David Schwimmer, LSE's chief executive officer. "", '', ""The valuation— 16.7x EV/adjusted 2019 EBITDA — is around the average for global exchanges. Therefore, the agreed amount is a reasonable price for LSE considering the Italian business' skew to cash trading and clearing."", '', ""For Euronext, the acquisition of Borsa marks a turning point in their history. By welcoming the third-largest economy in Europe, Euronext can diversify their revenue streams and geographical footprint. The sale has opened the doors for them to build the leading pan-European market infrastructure as well as creating the backbone of the European capital markets union, according to Euronext CEO Stephane Boujnah. This new opportunity will be streamlined from the integration of MTS, Borsa's bond trading platform, which will enable Euronext to enter into fixed income trading for the first time. Rather than from job cuts, the purchase's synergies will most likely be coming from adopting Borsa's MTS technology platform. While the deal is requiring €1.8B in debt and €2.4B  in new equity in funding, the acquisition gives the French operator 25% of all equity trading in Europe and a clearinghouse for the first time. Euronext will also see an improvement in their equity operations, the joint group operating with more than 1,800 listed companies—an accumulated market value of around  €4.4T."", '', 'On the day the deal had been announced, October 9, shares in LSE rose 0.2% in early trading. The group’s shareholders are confident about their decision to sell Borsa since the deal will bring Refinitiv’s acquisition one step closer. On the same day, shares closed 0.4%. Euronext saw a 0.6% rise in their shares in early trading on the news of the deal as shareholders unanimously backed the deal. However, Euronext’s stock saw a decline of 4.4% at closing, which could suggest dissatisfaction by investors for Borsa.', '', 'Figure 3. Euronext Price Development (SeekingAlpha)', '', 'With high market volatility caused by rising COVID-19 cases across Europe and stricter lockdown measures, there have been sporadic decreases on the European markets (see Figure 3). On October 28 shares in both LSE and Euronext closed down by 6.2 and 9.9%, likely as a result.', '', '', 'Long-term outlook', '', 'Adding Borsa Italiana to its collection of European stock exchanges, Euronext expands its position as one of the most important owners of market infrastructure in Europe. Stéphane Boujnah, chief executive of Euronext, called the deal “a turning point in our group’s history”, stating that the transaction “will create the backbone of the Capital Markets Union in Europe”. Euronext’s acquisition of Borsa Italiana makes Italy the largest contributor to the group, reflecting the deals’ long-term strategic importance.', '', 'Involving Borsa Italiana in its transnational consortium of stock exchanges allows Euronext to expand its operations with respect to its tremendous reach and impact on European capital markets. Its venues would be home to a quarter of Europe’s €30bn-a-day trading in equities, reflecting the extensive consolidation and reach of Euronext’s products and platforms. The contribution of Italy as a G7 economy allows the group to build on existing structures in Dublin, Oslo, Paris and other European countries, expanding its network to more potential customers and adding to its over 1,463 listed companies. This will allow the group to further connect markets and allow easy-to-access opportunities for investors. After gaining access to the Italian market, this long-term positioning will allow Euronext to concentrate on expanding its product and platform diversity, while continuously adding depth to operations in Italy.', '', 'The deal gives Borsa Italiana a clearinghouse for the first time as well as a securities depository, stock exchange and bond platform. As a result, Euronext’s Mr. Boujnah also expressed that revenue synergies from the deal would mainly be achieved by moving Borsa Italiana to Euronext’s technology platform rather than through job cuts. Access to this technology platform will allow Borsa Italiana to benefit from a greater variety of products and new clients through faster and more digital processes. These long term revenue synergies are extended by creating a network of integrated platforms of transnationally connected stock exchanges, accumulating European investors on their platform. By fostering Italy’s market diversity in bond and equity markets, as well as giving access to new technology, Euronext’s transferred capabilities will allow Borsa Italiana to achieve long term growth within the firm and generate efficiencies for investors.', '', ""Finally, the deal contains essential impacts on Italy’s political and economic landscape. In the long run, involved stakeholders are hoping for the deal to contribute to the Italian economy by giving investors easier access to markets but also through political ties established for the transaction. Borsa Italiana is seen as a strategic asset in Italy because of its ownership of MTS SpA, a platform used to trade government bonds. While this made the deal politically sensitive, Euronext executed the transaction by teaming up with state agency Cassa Depositi e Prestiti (CDP) and Italy's biggest bank Intesa SanPaolo. Cooperating with central Italian financial institutions will add to Euronext’s powerful position in European markets and increase flexibility in its operations due to direct access to decision makers in the country. "", '', '', 'Barriers to the closure of the deal', '', 'A strong motivating factor behind LSE’s sale of Borsa Italiana is the desire to meet the anti-competition concerns of the E.U. ahead of their planned $27B acquisition of Refinitiv. However, if there are significant changes to LSE’s commitment to the deal, the Borsa Italiana sale may be in jeopardy. Included in the terms of the agreement is a contingency on the Refinitiv deal going through. Therefore, if LSE attempts to withdraw from the Refinitiv deal by citing any of the exit clauses in that contract, the Borsa Italiana deal would likely not go through.', '', 'LSE may also be forced to not go through with the acquisition if the commitments that the LSE group makes to address anti-competition concerns are not enough to satisfy the E.U. regulator. For instance, LSE recently had to make commitments to keep its trading business separate from its interest rate derivatives clearing business. If LSE is unable or unwilling to make further commitments to meet the demands of the E.U. regulator and abandons the Refinitiv deal, they could swiftly turn around and look for the legal remedies they have included in the Borsa Italiana sale agreement to walk away from the transaction. ', '', 'Further, other remedies to meet E.U. regulators’ demands may also be successful. If measures less severe than the sale of Borsa Italiana suffice, LSE may look for options to walk away from the deal. Recent threats by LVMH to walk away in their agreed deal to purchase Tiffany’s illustrate the extent to which deals that have already been agreed to can still be amended. LSE could potentially use better circumstances in their negotiations with regulators to keep a hold of the valuable Borsa Italiana asset. ', '', 'As part of the agreement, both companies LSE and Euronext had to gain shareholder approval of the deal. Results at LSE’s general meeting overwhelmingly supported the deal; 291,694,564 votes for and only 4,193 submitted against. This is likely due to the appeal of the Refinitiv transaction, which is contingent on this sale.

', '', 'Microsoft Rationale ', '', 'As the gaming industry projects USD $160B in game sales this year there is a shift in focus from consoles to user engagement. This shift in focus has led to major consolidation in the industry. Xbox has always lacked exclusive titles compared to Sony, until last year when they surpassed Sony’s 14 gaming studios. Microsoft has led the industry in acquisitions, now controlling 23 studios compared to Sony’s 17. They now control Fallout, Doom, Elder Scrolls, and Quake. By controlling these titles Microsoft is able to make them exclusive and offer them on Xbox Game Pass. This acquisition comes as the new Xbox is being released to further incentivize consumers in an effort to disrupt Sony’s Playstation market share. ', '', 'Zenimax Rationale ', '', 'One of Zenimax’s key pain points in the past few years has been monetizing their games. In fact, Zenimax has struggled to achieve the right balance between quality and price in their games, with some of their recent games especially falling flat. With Microsoft supplying the capital for future projects, the Bethesda team will be able to focus more on ideation and innovation rather than cost and profit considerations. Peter Hines, the SVP of Global Marketing at Bethesda, explained the acquisition as a means for Zenimax to gain “access to resources that will make us a better publisher and developer.” ', '', 'Moreover, Zenimax will benefit from broader distribution, as its fans will now be able to access all of Bethesda’s games through the Xbox Game Pass. Likewise, Microsoft’s Xbox has long lagged behind Sony’s more exclusive and high-quality games, so Xbox users will likewise benefit from premier gaming titles like The Elder Scrolls and Wolfenstein (See Figure 1). Bethesda summarized the symbiotic nature of the transaction in a press release, stating that the biggest winners were the fans. ', '', '', 'Short Term Outlook', '', 'Game Portfolio Vertical Integration', '', 'Zenimax Group as a game publisher, will have no operational changes within their game development and engineering, which ensures a smooth cost-efficient integration. However, it will join XBox’s studios and share their resources such as Xbox’s mass distribution channel. Strategically, Microsoft will be able to vertically integrate by saving the licensing fees and result in higher gross margins when rolling-out their games to the broader market. ', '', 'Market Share Growth', '', ""With 2.7 billion people projected to play games this year and sales to exceed $160B Microsoft looks to continue to grow their market share by expanding their gaming portfolio. Microsoft's acquisition of Zenimax places pressures on Sony because games such as Deathloop and Ghostwire were supposed to be exclusively for PS5. Not only does this force Sony to pay down the line if they’d like to continue to offer these titles, but this can effectively sway consumers. By offering Zenimax titles to Xbox Game Pass, Microsoft looks to lead console sales this holiday season with a stronger game catalogue with titles such as Outer Worlds and Gears 5. "", '', 'Cloud Partnership with Sony', '', 'In the past decade, Microsoft’s Xbox and Sony’s Playstation have dominated the gaming console segment, representing 34.90% and 65.09% of the market. Microsoft and Sony are seen as the biggest rivalries in the hardware gaming industry and yet led to different generations of hardware improvement for Playstations and Xboxes.', '', 'On May 16, 2019, Microsoft and Sony reached a strategic partnership to develop new cloud-based solutions for direct-to-consumer entertainment and AI solutions. First, Playstation’s (Sony) cloud gaming service, Playstation Now, will not be supported under Microsoft’s Azure cloud infrastructure, allowing quicker delivery and higher quality. Secondly, Sony’s cutting-edge image sensors technology will further complement Microsoft’s Azure AI technology in AI experiences (In-Game Action Preciseness, Controller Settings). Thirdly and most importantly, Microsoft and Sony’s games will be integrated under one platform, thus these games will be accessible on either Playstation or Xbox.

With the emergence of Amazon, Apple, and Google, the strategic partnership implied a common interest for Microsoft and Sony to leverage their first-to-market advantage and defend their market share in a collaborative way. ', '', 'Cloud Gaming 3-Phase Transmission', '', 'The transition to cloud gaming is occurring in real-time and is part of the 2 phases of gaming; digitalisation of gaming and cloud gaming transmission. Both transitions can be explained by explaining the changes in the customer journey and the hardware.', '', 'Firstly, came physical to digital media. This is due to 2 main points. Firstly, the changes in the customer journey of selecting a game from buying a physical disc from a store to downloading a game from the relevant virtual store. Secondly, came the changes in hardware to make them either physical and digital or digital solely compatible, thus pushing legacy gamers away from solely relying on physical game media. This is shown in Figure 2, with the movement from the Xbox 360 to the Xbox One series, with the Xbox One S being digital only. Currently, gaming is transitioning into cloud gaming. The change in the customer journey goes hand in hand with the change in hardware requirements. Often, gamers could only play games limited by the capacity of their own console/PC. With cloud gaming, any hardware shortfalls are eliminated as one essentially plays the game by streaming the outputs onto their device whilst simultaneously streaming back the game inputs to a data centre server. ', '', 'What this now means is that gamers can choose any game of their choosing in the knowledge that they now have the capacity to do so. Now with software innovations such as Xbox Game Pass and Playstation Now, gamers can purchase games and then stream the gaming experience onto their device. This has resulted in massive changes for the fourth generation of Xbox. The digital only console, Xbox Series S, is significantly smaller than the dual media Xbox Series X due to reduced levels of hardware. The Xbox Series S is designed specifically for cloud gaming as hardware is no longer a consideration and the lower cost of the console starts to push gamers towards this new model of gaming', '', 'Continued Growth in Cloud Gaming', '', 'The growth in the global cloud gaming is an upside for this acquisition. By removing the requirement for hardware, cloud gaming allows users to play on smart devices with high-speech Internet. Cloud gaming also lifts barriers for cost-conscious consumers, thereby attracting casual gamers into the market. Grand View Research reports that the cloud gaming market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 47.9% from 2020 to 2027. North America is expected to see the strongest growth in that period due to higher R&D investment in cloud computing, more widespread adoption of smartphones, and the presence of high-speed Internet. Asia, too, will see a significant growth in the coming decade due to a massive untapped gaming population and the recent penetration of smartphones. ', '', 'The rise of 5G in developed countries like the US and South Korea is expected to contribute to this growth, as mobile gaming has been limited thus far to low-spec games. Consumer bandwidth has been an impediment for streaming services and game operators alike, so the recent spread of 5G will revolutionize connectivity at users’ homes and maximize the potential of cloud gaming. 5G’s higher speeds and lower latencies are truly a game changer for cloud gaming, as they will enable mobile devices to support more complex games and accelerate the transition away from casual low-spec games. In fact, a recent poll from the Mobile Video Industry Council found that anywhere between 25 to 50% of 5G data traffic will come from cloud gaming by 2022. Operators like Playgiga and Hatch are already forming partnerships with cloud-gaming providers like AT&T and Sprint. Overall, the growth in cloud gaming and 5G will only complement Microsoft’s shift from a device-centric strategy towards a player-centric one. ', '', '', 'Long Term Outlook', '', 'Consolidation Trends - Focus on Contents - Game Publisher / Streaming Targets', '', 'To be a successful player in the gaming industry, companies need to have global cloud infrastructure, hardware capabilities (whether that be client consoles/PCs or data centres) and library of streamable games. There has been a trend of consolidation within the gaming industry particularly when considering cloud gaming and creative studios. Microsoft itself has a long history of acquiring creative studios to create content to suit their hardware whether that be Xbox One or Windows 10 PC gaming. For instance, Microsoft acquired Lionhead Studios to develop Fable Legends to suit their desires. Firstly, Lionhead optimised the game for Xbox One, then for DirectX12 graphics for Windows 10 PC gamers and then Xbox One and Windows 10 Crossplay capabilities. Larger companies want to differentiate themselves with their game offerings by utilizing the creative talents of indie and smaller game developers (to attract prospective gamers) while also ensuring the content is compatible and promotes their own existing software and hardware. Hardware is another area where it is very plausible to see consolidation.

Unlike other competitors, Apple Arcade does not require users to purchase individual games after they subscribed, which is like Netflix’s “one price for all” business model. However, Apple has a limited number of games and tends to not include console games. With a 46% smartphone market share in the United States and 13.5% globally, Apple’s addressable market is limited to Apple users, therefore the network effect may not be as profound as other competitors.', '', 'Potential Entry - Facebook ', '', 'Facebook Gaming has launched in 2017, it serves Discord and Twitch as a streaming platform for gamers to stream their plays on PC. However, outside of streaming itself, Facebook has dedicated a lot of effort into Oculus’ Virtual Reality (VR) gaming development. Even though Facebook does not own any data centres that would support cloud gaming logistically, Facebook’s leading edge VR development could pose threats to Microsoft if VR gaming continues to cannibalize cloud or digital gaming segments.', '', 'Conclusion', '', 'Despite the cloud gaming space requiring significant barriers to entry, it has attracted most big technology companies to compete in the space because of its explosive growth opportunities in platform growth, traffic exposure and income opportunities.

Both institutions’ boards have approved of this deal, which is now only waiting to be sanctioned by the “Ministerio de Asuntos Económicos” and “Comisión Nacional de Los Mercados y la Competencia”. The presence of left-wing populist party “Podemos” in the governing coalition has given rise to rumours that they could resist the deal, but no real opposition is expected as the case for an oligopoly between CaixaBank and the other 4 big Spanish banks has already been debunked (the flow and rates of credit are not projected to be altered as a result of this or any future mergers, and they are in fact expected to become more competitive).', '', 'Instead, the main issue facing this merger at this stage (albeit not significant) will be the backlash at the prospective loss of employment; 30%-40% of Bankia’s offices expect to be closed, and 5,000-15,000 jobs are to be cut as a result of redundancies. The headquarters, however, will remain unchanged as both banks are based in the city of Valencia; CaixaBank moved its offices from Barcelona to Valencia following the civil unrest that gripped the city in 2017, as the massive protests for independence after an illegal referendum turned violent. Nonetheless, CaixaBank still retains significant influence in the Catalonia region; this alone should make the new entity into a Spanish banking powerhouse, ready to “rub shoulders with the largest European financial institutions”.', '', 'Another hot topic of debate around this merger has been how the Spanish government itself stands to benefit from this deal. This is because in 2012 the Spanish government bailed out Bankia as part of a €40 billion rescue package for the Spanish financial industry. This left them with a 60% stake in Bankia, (since then increased to 61.8%), a bank that had missed 3 straight deadlines (and by all means looking to miss a 4th one this January 2021) to take the company private and return the taxpayers’ money. Although in all likelihood this recouping of taxpayers’ funds still won’t take place after the merger, Luis de Guindos (ECB vice-president) has repeatedly defended bailing out Bankia, warning the “alternative would have been significantly more costly” and expressing hope that the merger might improve the situation. Moreover, after the merger, the State will see its stake diluted to a much more digestible 15% of a bank that looks to be more profitable than the weakened stand-alone Bankia. Consequently, the ECB and Banco de España have collectively voiced their approval of this deal, as the ECB actively encourages further consolidation of the European banking industry. This process is expected to take place “by stages”, with this merger seemingly being the first one.', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Oct 23, 2020', '6 min read', 'Sunrun acquires Vivint in all stock transaction valued at  $3.2 billion ', 'Sunrun acquires Vivint in all stock transaction valued at  $3.2 billion ', 'By Vadim Mandel (London School of Economics) ', 'By Vadim Mandel (London School of Economics) ', '', '', 'Overview of the Deal\xa0', 'Overview of the Deal\xa0', '', 'Sunrun (NYSE: RUN), America’s biggest rooftop- solar company has announced that it will be taking over rival Vivint Solar (VSLR) for $3.2bn in an all-stock transaction in one of the biggest deals in industry history expected to close in the 4th\xa0 quarter, pursuant to which each share of Vivint Solar common stock will be exchanged for 0.55 shares of Sunrun common stock, representing a combined\xa0 Enterprise Value of $9.2 billion.\xa0', 'Sunrun (NYSE: RUN), America’s biggest rooftop- solar company has announced', 'that it will be taking over rival Vivint Solar (VSLR) for $3.2bn in an ', 'transaction in one of the biggest deals in industry history expected to close in the 4th\xa0 quarter, pursuant to which each share of Vivint Solar common stock will be', 'exchanged for 0.55 shares of Sunrun common stock, representing a combined\xa0 Enterprise Value of $9.2 billion.\xa0', '', 'Vivint Solar stockholders are expected to own approximately 36% and Sunrun stockholders are expected to own approximately 64% of the fully diluted shares of the combined company.

The company's nearly $9.5B cash balance should decline upon close of the transaction, based on its estimated $7B cash outflow for the acquisition. Cash should quickly be replenished through strong free operating cash flow generation, which management has expected will exceed $4B in FY21 and FY22. The transaction will raise Salesforce's adjusted leverage from zero to the 1x area upon close, well below the downgrade trigger of 2x."", '', 'The acquisition has however been met with mixed reactions from its investors. Salesforce’s stock plunged on Dec 2, 2020 by 8.9% despite the announcement of positive income growth.

Having made as many as 60 acquisitions over the years, six of which occurred in 2019, investors are wary of Salesforce’s over-reliance on acquisition for growth. This is coupled with the fact that Slack has been underperforming its cloud peers during this work-from-home shift. For instance, Zoom’s Q3 revenue grew 365% while Slack’s grew a mere 39%. Video chat in Slack remains more basic than what rival Zoom has offered, limited to calls within an organization instead of letting a wider network of users jump on a virtual meeting.', '', '', 'Long-term outlook', '', 'Due to the lockdowns resulting from COVID-19, companies were forced to rapidly adapt overnight to be able to communicate remotely across all levels of a firm. During the pandemic, many companies were forced to move towards remote work operations. Using unified communication software, such as Slack and Microsoft Teams, firms adapted and found convenient ways to stay connected and on top of their business operations even when distantly separated. Aspects of remote work are likely to persist to a certain degree post-pandemic due to the convenience of messaging tools, as a survey conducted by RBC Capital Markets has shown that more than 40% of workers found workplace messaging tools as “absolutely critical” after COVID-19. Therefore, Salesforce’s long-term offering as an all-encompassing CRM provider will be significantly strengthened by their acquisition of Slack. ', '', 'Figure 5: Survey Result: Worker’s Opinion on Workplace Messaging Tools (Source)', '', ""In addition, after losing a bid against its competitor Microsoft to acquire LinkedIn in 2016, Salesforce aims to get back at Microsoft by making the acquisition of Slack. This move by Salesforce poses a great threat to Microsoft as Slack's usage hits the heart of Microsoft's most central products of its productivity suite, Microsoft Teams. In turn, Slack’s acquisition will not only generate long-run revenue synergies for the company but also help Salesforce better compete with its major rival Microsoft."", '', 'Another benefit that the consolidation brings is that Slack can help Salesforce bring traction to other CRM products. Previously, Microsoft has used its Teams software to cross-promote other Office 365 products. Similarly, Salesforce can integrate Slack with its other softwares to create a more complete productivity suite for its users. This way, the company can cross-sell or upsell its existing cloud service products, which contributes to the company’s consistent goal of 25% year-on-year growth in revenue. ', ' ', 'The acquisition of Slack contributes to the trend of M&A in the cloud software industry. With the acquisitions of Slack in 2020, Tableau in 2019, and MuleSoft in 2018, Salesforce’s CEO Marc Benioff is attempting to transform the company into a “one-stop shop” for all business operations related to sales and marketing. Ultimately, buying Slack may prompt Salesforce to acquire other online collaborative products to complement Slack, such as Dropbox for better document management and RingCentral for better video conferencing. Moreover, the trend of acquisition in the industry will continue as other SaaS companies like SAP and Oracle may be urged to conduct more M&As so they can better compete and keep up with the trend in the industry.', ' ', '', 'Figure 6: Salesforce’s Major Acquisition Timeline (2016-2020)', '', 'Risks and Uncertainties', '', ""As far as internal uncertainties go, the board of directors of both companies have approved the transaction with the Slack board recommending that Slack stakeholders approve the transaction and adopt the merger agreement. However, UBS analysts argue that with Salesforce's massive value and size that development to Slack’s software would not be given proper attention, noting that they are “less and less clear about the direction that Salesforce is heading”. With the short term of the acquisition geared towards linking Slack into the Salesforce portfolio, some things that customers are looking forward to in the near future may not come to fruition, which could severely impact Slack’s performance. "", '', 'On the other hand, Slack could be a distraction for Salesforce management and could therefore not be believed to be the best owner for Slack. A much better suited one could argue could be Google or Amazon as they could integrate Slack into their platforms, but that would be unlikely due to antitrust regulations. Furthermore, Slack’s growth should be a risk for Salesforce. They have not turned a profit since their initial public offering last year. Since Slack is a SaaS valued at multiples of revenue instead of profits, their growth forecast faces immense pressure on its ability to materialize as earnings. This is concerning for Salesforce, who would be giving up nearly 13% of their market value for the acquisition based on Slack’s EV/Sales multiple seen in Figure 2.  Further, if Salesforce were to affect Slack’s internal operations through the acquisition, some existing customers may be turned away, as many customers now enjoy Slack for their simplicity and neutrality. Given the risks of the deal and Salesforce’s valuation of over $200 billion, analysts have suggested that their investors root for an antitrust review to prevent the deal.', '', 'Naturally, any deal of this size is subject to antitrust speculation. An antitrust debate has arisen after Slack has said that they cannot compete without a “defensive acquisition” despite saying they wanted to stay independent. This brings about a larger issue regarding a power disparity revolving mostly around Big Tech. Nonetheless, Salesforce is expected to be successful in its acquisition of Slack. It remains to be seen whether Slack will stay an independent entity after the acquisition as Salesforce has rebranded both Demandware and ExactTarget as Salesforce Commerce Cloud and Marketing Cloud respectively, yet allowed Tableau, MuleSoft, and Quip to keep their branding.

If measures less severe than the sale of Borsa Italiana suffice, LSE may look for options to walk away from the deal.

This shift in focus has led to major consolidation in the industry. Xbox has always lacked exclusive titles compared to Sony, until last year when they surpassed Sony’s 14 gaming studios. Microsoft has led the industry in acquisitions, now controlling 23 studios compared to Sony’s 17. They now control Fallout, Doom, Elder Scrolls, and Quake. By controlling these titles Microsoft is able to make them exclusive and offer them on Xbox Game Pass. This acquisition comes as the new Xbox is being released to further incentivize consumers in an effort to disrupt Sony’s Playstation market share. ', '', 'Zenimax Rationale ', '', 'One of Zenimax’s key pain points in the past few years has been monetizing their games. In fact, Zenimax has struggled to achieve the right balance between quality and price in their games, with some of their recent games especially falling flat. With Microsoft supplying the capital for future projects, the Bethesda team will be able to focus more on ideation and innovation rather than cost and profit considerations. Peter Hines, the SVP of Global Marketing at Bethesda, explained the acquisition as a means for Zenimax to gain “access to resources that will make us a better publisher and developer.” ', '', 'Moreover, Zenimax will benefit from broader distribution, as its fans will now be able to access all of Bethesda’s games through the Xbox Game Pass. Likewise, Microsoft’s Xbox has long lagged behind Sony’s more exclusive and high-quality games, so Xbox users will likewise benefit from premier gaming titles like The Elder Scrolls and Wolfenstein (See Figure 1).

However, it will join XBox’s studios and share their resources such as Xbox’s mass distribution channel. Strategically, Microsoft will be able to vertically integrate by saving the licensing fees and result in higher gross margins when rolling-out their games to the broader market. ', '', 'Market Share Growth', '', ""With 2.7 billion people projected to play games this year and sales to exceed $160B Microsoft looks to continue to grow their market share by expanding their gaming portfolio. Microsoft's acquisition of Zenimax places pressures on Sony because games such as Deathloop and Ghostwire were supposed to be exclusively for PS5. Not only does this force Sony to pay down the line if they’d like to continue to offer these titles, but this can effectively sway consumers. By offering Zenimax titles to Xbox Game Pass, Microsoft looks to lead console sales this holiday season with a stronger game catalogue with titles such as Outer Worlds and Gears 5.

First, Playstation’s (Sony) cloud gaming service, Playstation Now, will not be supported under Microsoft’s Azure cloud infrastructure, allowing quicker delivery and higher quality. Secondly, Sony’s cutting-edge image sensors technology will further complement Microsoft’s Azure AI technology in AI experiences (In-Game Action Preciseness, Controller Settings).

', '', 'Cloud Gaming 3-Phase Transmission', '', 'The transition to cloud gaming is occurring in real-time and is part of the 2 phases of gaming; digitalisation of gaming and cloud gaming transmission. Both transitions can be explained by explaining the changes in the customer journey and the hardware.', '', 'Firstly, came physical to digital media. This is due to 2 main points. Firstly, the changes in the customer journey of selecting a game from buying a physical disc from a store to downloading a game from the relevant virtual store. Secondly, came the changes in hardware to make them either physical and digital or digital solely compatible, thus pushing legacy gamers away from solely relying on physical game media. This is shown in Figure 2, with the movement from the Xbox 360 to the Xbox One series, with the Xbox One S being digital only. Currently, gaming is transitioning into cloud gaming. The change in the customer journey goes hand in hand with the change in hardware requirements. Often, gamers could only play games limited by the capacity of their own console/PC. With cloud gaming, any hardware shortfalls are eliminated as one essentially plays the game by streaming the outputs onto their device whilst simultaneously streaming back the game inputs to a data centre server. ', '', 'What this now means is that gamers can choose any game of their choosing in the knowledge that they now have the capacity to do so. Now with software innovations such as Xbox Game Pass and Playstation Now, gamers can purchase games and then stream the gaming experience onto their device. This has resulted in massive changes for the fourth generation of Xbox. The digital only console, Xbox Series S, is significantly smaller than the dual media Xbox Series X due to reduced levels of hardware. The Xbox Series S is designed specifically for cloud gaming as hardware is no longer a consideration and the lower cost of the console starts to push gamers towards this new model of gaming', '', 'Continued Growth in Cloud Gaming', '', 'The growth in the global cloud gaming is an upside for this acquisition. By removing the requirement for hardware, cloud gaming allows users to play on smart devices with high-speech Internet. Cloud gaming also lifts barriers for cost-conscious consumers, thereby attracting casual gamers into the market. Grand View Research reports that the cloud gaming market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 47.9% from 2020 to 2027. North America is expected to see the strongest growth in that period due to higher R&D investment in cloud computing, more widespread adoption of smartphones, and the presence of high-speed Internet. Asia, too, will see a significant growth in the coming decade due to a massive untapped gaming population and the recent penetration of smartphones. ', '', 'The rise of 5G in developed countries like the US and South Korea is expected to contribute to this growth, as mobile gaming has been limited thus far to low-spec games. Consumer bandwidth has been an impediment for streaming services and game operators alike, so the recent spread of 5G will revolutionize connectivity at users’ homes and maximize the potential of cloud gaming. 5G’s higher speeds and lower latencies are truly a game changer for cloud gaming, as they will enable mobile devices to support more complex games and accelerate the transition away from casual low-spec games. In fact, a recent poll from the Mobile Video Industry Council found that anywhere between 25 to 50% of 5G data traffic will come from cloud gaming by 2022.

There has been a trend of consolidation within the gaming industry particularly when considering cloud gaming and creative studios. Microsoft itself has a long history of acquiring creative studios to create content to suit their hardware whether that be Xbox One or Windows 10 PC gaming. For instance, Microsoft acquired Lionhead Studios to develop Fable Legends to suit their desires. Firstly, Lionhead optimised the game for Xbox One, then for DirectX12 graphics for Windows 10 PC gamers and then Xbox One and Windows 10 Crossplay capabilities. Larger companies want to differentiate themselves with their game offerings by utilizing the creative talents of indie and smaller game developers (to attract prospective gamers) while also ensuring the content is compatible and promotes their own existing software and hardware.

Under Nvidia’s current business, the company focuses on its leading AI computing platform and ability to create datacenters and high-performance platforms. However, the company has been unable to move into the space of creating their own central processing unit (CPU) chip, which is used across all electronic computing devices, and has forced customers to look elsewhere to fill this need. Instead, Nvidia has used its abilities to create graphic enhancing chips such as its successful GeForce RTX series. ', '', 'Although with Arm now under Nvidia’s wing, the company has the potential to finally fill this gap since Arm has been expanding its presence to include the creation of chip designs and technologies that are used in central processors. While Arm’s chips alone haven’t been able to compete with those produced by industry leaders such as Intel or AMD, the combination of Arm’s chip-making ability and network with Nvidia’s experience in graphic enhancers and AI platforms could revolutionize the industry by giving Nvidia control of all necessary components.

The headquarters, however, will remain unchanged as both banks are based in the city of Valencia; CaixaBank moved its offices from Barcelona to Valencia following the civil unrest that gripped the city in 2017, as the massive protests for independence after an illegal referendum turned violent.

Moreover, after the merger, the State will see its stake diluted to a much more digestible 15% of a bank that looks to be more profitable than the weakened stand-alone Bankia.

This represents a year-on-year increase of approximately 21%, maintaining the company’s sales growth that has hovered around 26% in the past 5 years.', '', ""Immediate impacts on its capital structure are cushioned by Salesforce’s considerable cash balance.

The company's nearly $9.5B cash balance should decline upon close of the transaction, based on its estimated $7B cash outflow for the acquisition. Cash should quickly be replenished through strong free operating cash flow generation, which management has expected will exceed $4B in FY21 and FY22. The transaction will raise Salesforce's adjusted leverage from zero to the 1x area upon close, well below the downgrade trigger of 2x."", '', 'The acquisition has however been met with mixed reactions from its investors. Salesforce’s stock plunged on Dec 2, 2020 by 8.9% despite the announcement of positive income growth. Investors are mainly worried about the hefty price tag of $27.7B for Slack, which represents a 54% premium to its unaffected price or 26x forward sales. Having made as many as 60 acquisitions over the years, six of which occurred in 2019, investors are wary of Salesforce’s over-reliance on acquisition for growth. This is coupled with the fact that Slack has been underperforming its cloud peers during this work-from-home shift. For instance, Zoom’s Q3 revenue grew 365% while Slack’s grew a mere 39%. Video chat in Slack remains more basic than what rival Zoom has offered, limited to calls within an organization instead of letting a wider network of users jump on a virtual meeting.', '', '', 'Long-term outlook', '', 'Due to the lockdowns resulting from COVID-19, companies were forced to rapidly adapt overnight to be able to communicate remotely across all levels of a firm. During the pandemic, many companies were forced to move towards remote work operations. Using unified communication software, such as Slack and Microsoft Teams, firms adapted and found convenient ways to stay connected and on top of their business operations even when distantly separated. Aspects of remote work are likely to persist to a certain degree post-pandemic due to the convenience of messaging tools, as a survey conducted by RBC Capital Markets has shown that more than 40% of workers found workplace messaging tools as “absolutely critical” after COVID-19. Therefore, Salesforce’s long-term offering as an all-encompassing CRM provider will be significantly strengthened by their acquisition of Slack.

This move by Salesforce poses a great threat to Microsoft as Slack's usage hits the heart of Microsoft's most central products of its productivity suite, Microsoft Teams. In turn, Slack’s acquisition will not only generate long-run revenue synergies for the company but also help Salesforce better compete with its major rival Microsoft."", '', 'Another benefit that the consolidation brings is that Slack can help Salesforce bring traction to other CRM products. Previously, Microsoft has used its Teams software to cross-promote other Office 365 products. Similarly, Salesforce can integrate Slack with its other softwares to create a more complete productivity suite for its users. This way, the company can cross-sell or upsell its existing cloud service products, which contributes to the company’s consistent goal of 25% year-on-year growth in revenue. ', ' ', 'The acquisition of Slack contributes to the trend of M&A in the cloud software industry. With the acquisitions of Slack in 2020, Tableau in 2019, and MuleSoft in 2018, Salesforce’s CEO Marc Benioff is attempting to transform the company into a “one-stop shop” for all business operations related to sales and marketing. Ultimately, buying Slack may prompt Salesforce to acquire other online collaborative products to complement Slack, such as Dropbox for better document management and RingCentral for better video conferencing. Moreover, the trend of acquisition in the industry will continue as other SaaS companies like SAP and Oracle may be urged to conduct more M&As so they can better compete and keep up with the trend in the industry.', ' ', '', 'Figure 6: Salesforce’s Major Acquisition Timeline (2016-2020)', '', 'Risks and Uncertainties', '', ""As far as internal uncertainties go, the board of directors of both companies have approved the transaction with the Slack board recommending that Slack stakeholders approve the transaction and adopt the merger agreement. However, UBS analysts argue that with Salesforce's massive value and size that development to Slack’s software would not be given proper attention, noting that they are “less and less clear about the direction that Salesforce is heading”. With the short term of the acquisition geared towards linking Slack into the Salesforce portfolio, some things that customers are looking forward to in the near future may not come to fruition, which could severely impact Slack’s performance. "", '', 'On the other hand, Slack could be a distraction for Salesforce management and could therefore not be believed to be the best owner for Slack. A much better suited one could argue could be Google or Amazon as they could integrate Slack into their platforms, but that would be unlikely due to antitrust regulations. Furthermore, Slack’s growth should be a risk for Salesforce. They have not turned a profit since their initial public offering last year. Since Slack is a SaaS valued at multiples of revenue instead of profits, their growth forecast faces immense pressure on its ability to materialize as earnings. This is concerning for Salesforce, who would be giving up nearly 13% of their market value for the acquisition based on Slack’s EV/Sales multiple seen in Figure 2.  Further, if Salesforce were to affect Slack’s internal operations through the acquisition, some existing customers may be turned away, as many customers now enjoy Slack for their simplicity and neutrality. Given the risks of the deal and Salesforce’s valuation of over $200 billion, analysts have suggested that their investors root for an antitrust review to prevent the deal.', '', 'Naturally, any deal of this size is subject to antitrust speculation. An antitrust debate has arisen after Slack has said that they cannot compete without a “defensive acquisition” despite saying they wanted to stay independent. This brings about a larger issue regarding a power disparity revolving mostly around Big Tech. Nonetheless, Salesforce is expected to be successful in its acquisition of Slack. It remains to be seen whether Slack will stay an independent entity after the acquisition as Salesforce has rebranded both Demandware and ExactTarget as Salesforce Commerce Cloud and Marketing Cloud respectively, yet allowed Tableau, MuleSoft, and Quip to keep their branding.

This seems to be the next piece of the puzzle from turning into the dominant player to the podcast world.  Spotify has already acquired Gimlet Media, a podcast network, and a podcast creation app, Anchor. The acquisition of Megaphone is in the light of a Q3 2019 earning call where Daniel Ek, the CEO of Spotify commented that ‘monetization of podcasts .. is something that we’re going to start looking at in 2020.’ This deal is aimed at penetrating the podcast ad market through the power of the Megaphone Targeted Marketplace and Spotify’s Streaming Ad Insertion service.', '', '', 'Megaphone Business Model', '', 'Megaphone is an end-to-end platform manager for creators to publish, monetize, and measure their podcasts with its user-friendly product surface (See Exhibit 1).

Podcasts Ads operating on Megaphone are populated upon podcast download, the messaging is personalized according to the listener’s profile (i.e. age, nationality, gender) and listening habits (frequency, podcast choices, first/frequent listener, etc). As a result, creators are enabled to benefit from more efficient ad targeting executions. ', '', '', 'Deal Rationale', '', 'Megaphone’s hosting platform is the biggest value-add to Spotify, as it will now be able to scale and monetize its SAI technology. Introduced only earlier this year, Spotify’s proprietary SAI technology allows it to optimize the ads that users hear in each podcast based on their geolocation, age, music preferences, podcast listening history, Spotify friends, and other data. Jason Richman, Spotify’s VP of Global Advertising Business and Platform, explained that the acquisition was ultimately “a big play for scale.” Spotify can now roll out its advertising optimization software across a broader portfolio of podcasts and generate higher returns on the advertiser front. From a competitive standpoint, the acquisition will further increase the profit potential for advertisers and cement Spotify as the podcast service of choice. ', '', 'Seller Rationale: Larger Distribution Channel', '', 'Partnering with Spotify allows Megaphone to reach a larger audience and expand upon creators’ already impressive offering of shows and podcasts. Namely, Spotify will offer its unique “Streaming Ad Insertion” to podcast publishers utilizing Megaphone’s services. Additionally, Spotify boasts more than a million podcasts on the app. Megaphone will not have to worry as much about marketing and outreach now that they have access to myriad shows. Without having to worry about distribution, Megaphone can spend more of its time working on its services and offerings. ', '', 'The acquisition will undoubtedly pressure other companies to offer a certain level of flexibility in terms of advertising and publishing. As Spotify podcast publishers can now decide how their podcasts are monetized, it incentivizes new publishers to distribute their podcast and advertisers to target specific niches on Spotify. ', '', '', 'ShortTerm Outlook ', '', 'In the short run, the acquisition will allow Spotify to scale and monetize SAI by bringing to more than 20,000 publishers on Megaphone’s platform. Thus far, SAI has been a premium, niche product, and the advertiser demand has outstripped Spotify’s inventory. Megaphone will allow Spotify to fill the gap and use the size of Spotify’s and Megaphone’s combined audience to attract new consumer advertisers. Moreover, the acquisition will further solidify Spotify’s position as the premier end-to-end solution for podcast creators. From Megaphone’s advanced video editing tools and volume forecasting software to Spotify’s trademark SAI technology, the broad podcast creation toolkit will now be centralized under the Spotify brand.

Spotify’s historical acquisition focus is on developing its core music streaming service by increasingly investing in data-driven music discovery techniques with the acquisition of Tunigo in 2014 and Sonalytic in 2017, and Spotify’s cutting-edge, targeted music recommendation algorithm with the acquisition of Niland. In 2019, Spotify decided to double down in the podcast industry, with the acquisitions of Parcast and Anchor FM, to expand Spotify’s library of podcast offerings.', '', 'In 2020 February, Spotify acquired The Ringer, a sports & pop culture podcast network, to continue expanding its product offerings and make these podcasts only available on Spotify. As the podcast industry continues to get competitive, Spotify is likely to continue its acquisition strategy to expand its podcast platform and integrate SAI tools within podcast publishers.', '', 'In addition, Spotify has conducted strategic partnerships with Joe Rogan, Michelle Obama, and Kim Kardashian West with exclusive streaming licenses, marking Spotify’s intention to expand its audio library beyond music. ', '', 'Spotify has come to dominate the music streaming industry since its launch in 2008 through three key growth strategies: cost leadership, market development, and market penetration. ', '', 'For one, Spotify is a cost leader in that its ad-based business model supports a broad base of free users, who have access to radio-style streaming. Second, Spotify has developed the market demand for music streaming through tactical brand-name partnerships. ', 'Back in 2010, for example, Spotify partnered with Facebook to allow its users to send songs to their friends through the social media platform. More recently, Spotify and Hulu announced a joint plan in 2018 to allow customers to access both services for $12.99 per month; for reference, Spotify Premium costs $9.99 per month, while Hulu’s is $7.99. In 2019, Spotify expanded its reach by partnering with Amazon to stream its free music service on Alexa devices. These partnerships and joint ventures have allowed Spotify to increase exposure via different content platforms to capture market share. ', '', 'Spotify’s third growth strategy is market penetration. By 2016, Spotify had conquered six unique country markets in Asia, despite the idiosyncrasy of each one. Spotify did so through “localization,” i.e. by tailoring their offerings to local tastes and adjusting their pricing to local expectations. Network effects have abetted Spotify’s international expansion, as the value of Spotify’s platform grows with every additional user and artist. Meanwhile, its economies of scale have increased profitability, as its growing brand value and increasingly large user base have decreased fixed costs per customer over time.

The entire industry has seen a phenomenal increase in demand. This growth is expected to result in 131 million monthly users by 2024. It is no wonder Spotify has made such a push to dominate the market. Podcasting revenue is expected to hit $1.1 billion in 2021; this growth will benefit the many publishers and advertising companies that take advantage of the acquisition between Spotify and Megaphone and their new ad based systems.

For those Americans that regularly listen to podcasts, the average listening time was 6 hours, 39 minutes. Advertising has also seen many benefits from the increased consumption of podcasts. Roughly 54% of podcasts listeners stated they were more likely to buy something from a brand after hearing its advertisement on a podcast. ', '', ""The introduction of dynamically targeted ads to the podcast industry could be pivotal for companies looking to accelerate advertising revenue. Roughly 90% of Spotify's revenue comes from its subscription service, however, new advertising technology could serve as a catalyst not only for Spotify but other streaming services as well. Spotify has placed an emphasis on audio services rather than strictly music services, a trend which will be replicated by companies like Apple, Amazon, and Google. "", '', 'In the future, podcast publishers will begin to expect more flexibility in their capabilities. This includes “the opportunity to opt-in to have their content monetized, matching their listeners with even greater demand from advertisers.” This flexibility will be expected from other streaming services as well, and if it is not met, Spotify can expect to absorb those publishers.

As COVID-19 subsides, consumer consumption will increase as well, as individuals commute and travel, and those who started listening to podcasts during quarantine continue. Apple currently maintains roughly 19% of the user market with Spotify at 30%. The competition will be fierce as streaming services look to make acquisitions in order to maintain their place within the market.

As of the first quarter of 2020, Spotify remains at arm’s length of its fiercest competitor, Apple Music, which recorded a little over half the number of paid memberships to its services in comparison to Spotify. Furthermore, if we observe other metrics, we will see that Spotify remains ahead on all fronts. ', '', 'In a statement released by Spotify they disclosed that “relative to Apple, the publicly available data shows that our monthly engagement is roughly 2x as high and our churn is at half the rate” (Spotify, 2019). It is important to understand that Spotify continues to grow at a steady rate and therefore it must look for ways to innovate its service. Bring new features or further developing the podcast platform can help them maintain their advantage over Apple Music.', ' ', ' It is also important to highlight that Spotify has not quite yet established itself as the dominant company within the podcast industry. Yes, on a larger scale, it is competing with Apple Music, but in the podcast industry, it still faces fierce competition from companies. As a matter of fact, “Spotify isn’t the only company hoping that its exclusive podcasts will compel listeners to pay for access.

A great portion of the world population stayed home and did not commute to work. Initially, commuting was identified as the primary time frame for podcast listening and therefore, in its absence, experts believe the demand for podcasts would decrease. However, “U.S. weekly podcast downloads were up 20% for the week ending April 19 compared to the first week of January, Podtrac said” (Lee,2020). This can be attributed to the fact that individuals who stayed home had a surplus of time which they devoted listening to their favourite podcasts.', '', 'If we take a look at podcast producers, rather than listeners, it is also interesting to underline that Spotify is facilitating the production of podcasts so it can be a simple process carried out at home. In fact, “because podcasts can be produced remotely without crews, the pandemic has not disrupted Spotify’s slate of shows” (Lee, 2020).

As a result, Euronext’s Mr. Boujnah also expressed that revenue synergies from the deal would mainly be achieved by moving Borsa Italiana to Euronext’s technology platform rather than through job cuts. Access to this technology platform will allow Borsa Italiana to benefit from a greater variety of products and new clients through faster and more digital processes. These long term revenue synergies are extended by creating a network of integrated platforms of transnationally connected stock exchanges, accumulating European investors on their platform. By fostering Italy’s market diversity in bond and equity markets, as well as giving access to new technology, Euronext’s transferred capabilities will allow Borsa Italiana to achieve long term growth within the firm and generate efficiencies for investors.', '', ""Finally, the deal contains essential impacts on Italy’s political and economic landscape. In the long run, involved stakeholders are hoping for the deal to contribute to the Italian economy by giving investors easier access to markets but also through political ties established for the transaction. Borsa Italiana is seen as a strategic asset in Italy because of its ownership of MTS SpA, a platform used to trade government bonds. While this made the deal politically sensitive, Euronext executed the transaction by teaming up with state agency Cassa Depositi e Prestiti (CDP) and Italy's biggest bank Intesa SanPaolo. Cooperating with central Italian financial institutions will add to Euronext’s powerful position in European markets and increase flexibility in its operations due to direct access to decision makers in the country. "", '', '', 'Barriers to the closure of the deal', '', 'A strong motivating factor behind LSE’s sale of Borsa Italiana is the desire to meet the anti-competition concerns of the E.U. ahead of their planned $27B acquisition of Refinitiv. However, if there are significant changes to LSE’s commitment to the deal, the Borsa Italiana sale may be in jeopardy. Included in the terms of the agreement is a contingency on the Refinitiv deal going through. Therefore, if LSE attempts to withdraw from the Refinitiv deal by citing any of the exit clauses in that contract, the Borsa Italiana deal would likely not go through.', '', 'LSE may also be forced to not go through with the acquisition if the commitments that the LSE group makes to address anti-competition concerns are not enough to satisfy the E.U. regulator. For instance, LSE recently had to make commitments to keep its trading business separate from its interest rate derivatives clearing business. If LSE is unable or unwilling to make further commitments to meet the demands of the E.U. regulator and abandons the Refinitiv deal, they could swiftly turn around and look for the legal remedies they have included in the Borsa Italiana sale agreement to walk away from the transaction. ', '', 'Further, other remedies to meet E.U. regulators’ demands may also be successful. If measures less severe than the sale of Borsa Italiana suffice, LSE may look for options to walk away from the deal. Recent threats by LVMH to walk away in their agreed deal to purchase Tiffany’s illustrate the extent to which deals that have already been agreed to can still be amended. LSE could potentially use better circumstances in their negotiations with regulators to keep a hold of the valuable Borsa Italiana asset.

Results at LSE’s general meeting overwhelmingly supported the deal; 291,694,564 votes for and only 4,193 submitted against.

Microsoft has led the industry in acquisitions, now controlling 23 studios compared to Sony’s 17. They now control Fallout, Doom, Elder Scrolls, and Quake. By controlling these titles Microsoft is able to make them exclusive and offer them on Xbox Game Pass. This acquisition comes as the new Xbox is being released to further incentivize consumers in an effort to disrupt Sony’s Playstation market share. ', '', 'Zenimax Rationale ', '', 'One of Zenimax’s key pain points in the past few years has been monetizing their games. In fact, Zenimax has struggled to achieve the right balance between quality and price in their games, with some of their recent games especially falling flat.

', '', 'Market Share Growth', '', ""With 2.7 billion people projected to play games this year and sales to exceed $160B Microsoft looks to continue to grow their market share by expanding their gaming portfolio. Microsoft's acquisition of Zenimax places pressures on Sony because games such as Deathloop and Ghostwire were supposed to be exclusively for PS5. Not only does this force Sony to pay down the line if they’d like to continue to offer these titles, but this can effectively sway consumers.

', '', 'Cloud Gaming 3-Phase Transmission', '', 'The transition to cloud gaming is occurring in real-time and is part of the 2 phases of gaming; digitalisation of gaming and cloud gaming transmission. Both transitions can be explained by explaining the changes in the customer journey and the hardware.', '', 'Firstly, came physical to digital media. This is due to 2 main points. Firstly, the changes in the customer journey of selecting a game from buying a physical disc from a store to downloading a game from the relevant virtual store. Secondly, came the changes in hardware to make them either physical and digital or digital solely compatible, thus pushing legacy gamers away from solely relying on physical game media. This is shown in Figure 2, with the movement from the Xbox 360 to the Xbox One series, with the Xbox One S being digital only. Currently, gaming is transitioning into cloud gaming. The change in the customer journey goes hand in hand with the change in hardware requirements. Often, gamers could only play games limited by the capacity of their own console/PC. With cloud gaming, any hardware shortfalls are eliminated as one essentially plays the game by streaming the outputs onto their device whilst simultaneously streaming back the game inputs to a data centre server. ', '', 'What this now means is that gamers can choose any game of their choosing in the knowledge that they now have the capacity to do so. Now with software innovations such as Xbox Game Pass and Playstation Now, gamers can purchase games and then stream the gaming experience onto their device. This has resulted in massive changes for the fourth generation of Xbox. The digital only console, Xbox Series S, is significantly smaller than the dual media Xbox Series X due to reduced levels of hardware. The Xbox Series S is designed specifically for cloud gaming as hardware is no longer a consideration and the lower cost of the console starts to push gamers towards this new model of gaming', '', 'Continued Growth in Cloud Gaming', '', 'The growth in the global cloud gaming is an upside for this acquisition. By removing the requirement for hardware, cloud gaming allows users to play on smart devices with high-speech Internet. Cloud gaming also lifts barriers for cost-conscious consumers, thereby attracting casual gamers into the market. Grand View Research reports that the cloud gaming market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 47.9% from 2020 to 2027. North America is expected to see the strongest growth in that period due to higher R&D investment in cloud computing, more widespread adoption of smartphones, and the presence of high-speed Internet. Asia, too, will see a significant growth in the coming decade due to a massive untapped gaming population and the recent penetration of smartphones. ', '', 'The rise of 5G in developed countries like the US and South Korea is expected to contribute to this growth, as mobile gaming has been limited thus far to low-spec games. Consumer bandwidth has been an impediment for streaming services and game operators alike, so the recent spread of 5G will revolutionize connectivity at users’ homes and maximize the potential of cloud gaming. 5G’s higher speeds and lower latencies are truly a game changer for cloud gaming, as they will enable mobile devices to support more complex games and accelerate the transition away from casual low-spec games. In fact, a recent poll from the Mobile Video Industry Council found that anywhere between 25 to 50% of 5G data traffic will come from cloud gaming by 2022. Operators like Playgiga and Hatch are already forming partnerships with cloud-gaming providers like AT&T and Sprint. Overall, the growth in cloud gaming and 5G will only complement Microsoft’s shift from a device-centric strategy towards a player-centric one. ', '', '', 'Long Term Outlook', '', 'Consolidation Trends - Focus on Contents - Game Publisher / Streaming Targets', '', 'To be a successful player in the gaming industry, companies need to have global cloud infrastructure, hardware capabilities (whether that be client consoles/PCs or data centres) and library of streamable games. There has been a trend of consolidation within the gaming industry particularly when considering cloud gaming and creative studios. Microsoft itself has a long history of acquiring creative studios to create content to suit their hardware whether that be Xbox One or Windows 10 PC gaming. For instance, Microsoft acquired Lionhead Studios to develop Fable Legends to suit their desires. Firstly, Lionhead optimised the game for Xbox One, then for DirectX12 graphics for Windows 10 PC gamers and then Xbox One and Windows 10 Crossplay capabilities. Larger companies want to differentiate themselves with their game offerings by utilizing the creative talents of indie and smaller game developers (to attract prospective gamers) while also ensuring the content is compatible and promotes their own existing software and hardware. Hardware is another area where it is very plausible to see consolidation.

Like Google, Amazon has the largest gaming streaming channel, Twitch and the largest cloud service provider, Amazon Web Services (AWS). However, Amazon’s largest competitive advantage is its prime customer base, the roll-out strategy for Amazon will primarily include bundles with its existing offerings in other fields and as Amazon develops more hardware capabilities, it will eventually compete on the same level as Sony, Microsoft and Google.', '', 'Apple Competitive Advantage: iOS Ecosystem & Hardware', '', 'Apple Arcade is one of many of Apple’s strategic initiatives to move away from its reliance on hardware sales because of the stagnation of iPhone/iPad sales growth. Unlike other competitors, Apple Arcade does not require users to purchase individual games after they subscribed, which is like Netflix’s “one price for all” business model. However, Apple has a limited number of games and tends to not include console games. With a 46% smartphone market share in the United States and 13.5% globally, Apple’s addressable market is limited to Apple users, therefore the network effect may not be as profound as other competitors.', '', 'Potential Entry - Facebook ', '', 'Facebook Gaming has launched in 2017, it serves Discord and Twitch as a streaming platform for gamers to stream their plays on PC. However, outside of streaming itself, Facebook has dedicated a lot of effort into Oculus’ Virtual Reality (VR) gaming development.

If completed, the deal would be one of the biggest transactions of 2020. The selling firm SoftBank, which acquired Arm for $31.4B in 2015, will receive $21.5B in Nvidia stock and $12B in cash. $2B of the cash portion of the deal will be paid as soon as the signing is completed. There are also specific financial targets included in the proposed deal which could see SoftBank earn up to $5B in performance related payments. As part of the agreement, $1.5B of Nvidia stock will also be issued to Arm employees; Arm’s employees were a valuable asset contributing to the deal’s massive $40B price tag. ', '', 'Through the acquisition, Nvidia will be able to laterally diversify its revenue sources beyond its core competencies. While both firms operate within the same wider semiconductors industry, their product offerings differ greatly. Nvidia focuses largely on the production and sale of graphics processing cards (GPUs), widely used in gaming computers and for data centers. In fact, 87% of their revenues alone in 2019 were generated from GPU sales. On the other hand, Arm’s business model is the licensing of their intellectual property, largely for microprocessor and CPU technology. Over 25% of all electronic devices and 95% of mobile phones use technology licensed by Arm. ', '', 'From the seller SoftBank’s perspective, the company highlighted that they believed Arm would create more shareholder value combined with Nvidia. As the deal is financed in majority by Nvidia stock and includes performance-related payment hurdles, Softbank retains an aligned interest in the long-term success of both Arm and Nvidia. Moreover, SoftBank has experienced a number of high-profile failures and controversies that have resulted in increased investor scrutiny, such as the highly scrutinized Nasdaq options “whale trades”. When SoftBank acquired Arm in 2016 for $32B, its share price fell over 7%. In reaction to news of the sale, SoftBank’s share price rose almost 10%. ', '', 'Through the sale of Arm to Nvidia, in which SoftBank will receive Nvidia stock, SoftBank has managed to sell the company in a deal worth $8B more than their initial purchase price. What is particularly interesting about the deal is that SoftBank has effectively retained an interest in Arm Holdings, while enhancing their liquidity. As Nvidia stock is a massive component of how the deal is financed, SoftBank will become a major shareholder in Nvidia and will have improved future liquidity for a later exit opportunity through public markets. On top of Arm’s growth, SoftBank also gains access to Nvidia’s growing chip manufacturing business. To show the historical growth that Nvidia has experienced, their share price performance since the date of SoftBank’s initial acquisition of Arm is illustrated below in Figure 1.

Indeed, billions of chips are sold each year thanks to the substantial number of smartphone devices that adopt Arm-based microcontrollers. Thus, with this acquisition Nvidia has entered the smartphone business through the front door, taking advantage of the steady growth that Arm has already experienced in this market. The deal has tremendous benefits for Arm’s ecosystem, enhancing Arm’s R&D capacity and expanding its IP portfolio with NVIDIA’s world-leading GPU and AI technology. Arm partners will also benefit from both companies’ offerings, including NVIDIA’s numerous innovations. ', '', ""The two companies will continue to be autonomous, with Arm remaining headquartered in Cambridge. Nvidia plans to expand on this site to build a world-class AI research facility, supporting developments in healthcare, life sciences, robotics, self-driving cars, and other fields. In order to attract researchers and scientists from all over the world to develop new groundbreaking projects, NVIDIA will build a state-of-the-art AI supercomputer, powered by Arm CPUs, together with training facilities for developers and a startup incubator. Arm Cambridge will be a world-class technology center. Arm will continue to operate with the current open licensing model which the buyer will use to scale up its artificial intelligence technology and to stimulate growth in new markets such as robotics, automotive, and high-performance computing. Arm's CEO will continue to be Simon Segars."", ""\nThe market reacted positively to the announcement of the deal, driving Nvidia's share price up as much as 8% and adding more than $25B to its equity value, which corresponds to about two-thirds of the equity needed to make the acquisition. Moreover, SoftBank shares value grew about 9% on news of the deal and renewed talks for the company going private.\n"", 'Long Term Outlook ', '', 'Nvidia’s acquisition of Arm has the potential to upend the entire mobile technology and chip designing industry. Under Nvidia’s current business, the company focuses on its leading AI computing platform and ability to create datacenters and high-performance platforms. However, the company has been unable to move into the space of creating their own central processing unit (CPU) chip, which is used across all electronic computing devices, and has forced customers to look elsewhere to fill this need. Instead, Nvidia has used its abilities to create graphic enhancing chips such as its successful GeForce RTX series. ', '', 'Although with Arm now under Nvidia’s wing, the company has the potential to finally fill this gap since Arm has been expanding its presence to include the creation of chip designs and technologies that are used in central processors. While Arm’s chips alone haven’t been able to compete with those produced by industry leaders such as Intel or AMD, the combination of Arm’s chip-making ability and network with Nvidia’s experience in graphic enhancers and AI platforms could revolutionize the industry by giving Nvidia control of all necessary components.

Intel currently leads the global market share in both CPUs and GPUs. If implemented successfully, the combined capabilities of Nvidia and Arm together could lead to the more commonplace adoption of Nvidia chips in portable electronic devices and reduce the market shares of Intel and AMD in the CPU sector, making Nvidia a global rival with Intel. However, given that the two companies currently do not have many overlapping products, such potential synergy creation likely would not be seen for quite some time. Nonetheless, Nvidia’s control over Arm would allow the company to directly shape its future direction to align with its own.', '', '', 'Barriers to closure/Risks & Uncertainties', 'Barriers to closure/Risks & Uncertainties', '', 'With this acquisition of Arm being the largest to date in the mobile chip sector, the $40B deal is subject to close scrutiny.

Arm has licensing connections with the majority of companies that make mobile-device processors and other variations of chips, and many of these same companies are direct competitors with Nvidia or have the potential to be in the future. ', '', 'The regulatory approval process was fast in 2016 when SoftBank acquired Arm since the Japanese conglomerate was not directly competing with any of Arm’s clients. Even though Nvidia no longer develops smartphone chips, they are the world leader in graphic processing chips. Acquiring Arm gives them the potential to access the British company’s shipment volume and pricing information, so it wouldn’t be surprising if after the acquisition the company soon begins to develop products that would compete with Arm’s customer’s products. ', '', 'Another barrier to the global approval process is the escalating hostile relationship between the U.S. and China. Semiconductors have been caught in the middle of the trade and technology war between the two countries as the industry represents tech supremacy. The Nvidia-Arm deal is projected to have a very lengthy approval process; even Nvidia’s acquisition of Mellanox took over a year given its uncontroversial nature. ', '', 'Arm’s chips are the main structure for high-level electronics controlled by Big Tech and militaries, and the company coming into American control could create complications as the tech war heats up, especially as Beijing plans to halt foreign supply shipments. Long-term we could be witnessing more and more Chinese companies dissociate from Arm’s products to prevent their sensitive client data from being in the hands of the U.S. and to eliminate the fear of their supply being potentially cut-off one day. Nvidia reportedly does not expect exports to be an issue as Arm would continue to be headquartered in the U.K. ', '', 'Other than regulatory approval uncertainties, Hauser has been an outspoken opponent of the deal over fears that Nvidia would not keep their sizable workforce and R&D focused in their headquarters under the acquisition despite their promises. Currently, more than 3,000 employees are based in Britain but there are worries that the workforce will decrease in the future. Hauser expressed similar concerns over the SoftBank acquisition in 2016, but admits the company kept its promises to keep Cambridge as the main site of Arm’s research. Nvidia has stressed that they will keep the headquarters in Cambridge and invest in a new AI research center there. ', '', 'This $40B acquisition is not without several barriers to complete the deal and the risks posed to other firms are difficult to determine. While there is no conflict of interest as of now, the nature to which there will be in the future is unpredictable, but most definitely possible to be high. Nvidia will have to find the right balance between their own innovation and the work of Arm. Arm will ultimately need to be granted a level of independence to avoid government interjection and a loss of major clients to truly make their sizable investment worthwhile.

Although the deal is classified as a merger, it is essentially a takeover of Bankia by CaixaBank – they are 3x greater in market value and 2x as large in assets. As a result, other Spanish banks are growing keen on buying or joining rival banks to explore strategic options and be in a stronger position for cross-border deals. The merger also allows for CaixaBank to make significant annual cost cuts, resulting in increased revenue of about 1.1 billion (EUR). Together, the consolidated Spanish bank is expected to generate approximately 770 million (EUR) in cost synergies and within the next five years and is projected to reach an estimated annual revenue of 290 million (EUR).', ' ', 'The short-term consequences of the CaixaBank takeover are significant; there are a considerable number of job shutdowns and closing branches that come with the synergy. The main trade union Workers’ Commission (CCOO) has estimated over 51,000 staff to lose employment and approximately 6,300 branches to close in Spain. ', ' ', 'On the other hand, with the profitability of Spanish banks at risk due to low interest rates, subdued credit demand, and increased regulatory costs, the merger has allowed for CaixaBank to dramatically reduce overcapacity and increase profits. CaixaBank, with connections deep throughout a thriving Catalonia, will be able to broaden their presence into the nation’s large consumer and economic structure. In doing so, the Spanish banks will be able to cut off punitive competition and recover from their slowly diminishing profitability.', ' ', '“With this operation, we will form the principal Spanish franchise at a moment when it’s more necessary than ever to create entities with a critical size,” ', 'Goirigolzarri (Current President of Bankia)', '', '', 'Long-term consequences', '', 'This acquisition projects to be the beginning of what has been denominated “a new era in the Spanish banking sector”, as the Spanish banking industry looks to quickly consolidate in order to mitigate the adverse effects of the coronavirus pandemic. This, in fact, has been the decisive factor behind this merger, which was once before proposed in 2012 albeit with an unsuccessful outcome (the situation for the banks then was not as dire as the current one, with analysts describing the rationale behind this deal as a “question of survival”).', '', 'Amongst an agonizing Spanish economy, other banks will be looking to swiftly follow CaixaBank and Bankia’s footsteps. Rumours include Santander acquiring Bankinter or a BBVA merger with Banco Sabadell, as these entities hope to remain on top of their competition (before the merger, BBVA and Santander ranked first and second respectively amongst Spanish financial institutions, with both now trailing the post-merger CaixaBank in terms of assets and market share). Altogether these banks already comprise 72.4% of all financial assets held nationally, with these figures only looking to increase as the industry consolidates further.', '', 'Experts in fact consider larger national banks acquiring smaller entities to be but the onset of an increasing trend, and one that could expand well beyond international frontiers; with Spanish banks merging with those from other European nations such as Italy (where the sector is highly fragmented), France or Germany (where banks are facing similar profitability issues). Many believe this will lead to a wave of mergers that will leave behind a highly concentrated future banking sector; namely a “handful of big players”.

Both institutions’ boards have approved of this deal, which is now only waiting to be sanctioned by the “Ministerio de Asuntos Económicos” and “Comisión Nacional de Los Mercados y la Competencia”. The presence of left-wing populist party “Podemos” in the governing coalition has given rise to rumours that they could resist the deal, but no real opposition is expected as the case for an oligopoly between CaixaBank and the other 4 big Spanish banks has already been debunked (the flow and rates of credit are not projected to be altered as a result of this or any future mergers, and they are in fact expected to become more competitive).', '', 'Instead, the main issue facing this merger at this stage (albeit not significant) will be the backlash at the prospective loss of employment; 30%-40% of Bankia’s offices expect to be closed, and 5,000-15,000 jobs are to be cut as a result of redundancies. The headquarters, however, will remain unchanged as both banks are based in the city of Valencia; CaixaBank moved its offices from Barcelona to Valencia following the civil unrest that gripped the city in 2017, as the massive protests for independence after an illegal referendum turned violent. Nonetheless, CaixaBank still retains significant influence in the Catalonia region; this alone should make the new entity into a Spanish banking powerhouse, ready to “rub shoulders with the largest European financial institutions”.', '', 'Another hot topic of debate around this merger has been how the Spanish government itself stands to benefit from this deal. This is because in 2012 the Spanish government bailed out Bankia as part of a €40 billion rescue package for the Spanish financial industry. This left them with a 60% stake in Bankia, (since then increased to 61.8%), a bank that had missed 3 straight deadlines (and by all means looking to miss a 4th one this January 2021) to take the company private and return the taxpayers’ money. Although in all likelihood this recouping of taxpayers’ funds still won’t take place after the merger, Luis de Guindos (ECB vice-president) has repeatedly defended bailing out Bankia, warning the “alternative would have been significantly more costly” and expressing hope that the merger might improve the situation. Moreover, after the merger, the State will see its stake diluted to a much more digestible 15% of a bank that looks to be more profitable than the weakened stand-alone Bankia. Consequently, the ECB and Banco de España have collectively voiced their approval of this deal, as the ECB actively encourages further consolidation of the European banking industry.

Investors are mainly worried about the hefty price tag of $27.7B for Slack, which represents a 54% premium to its unaffected price or 26x forward sales. Having made as many as 60 acquisitions over the years, six of which occurred in 2019, investors are wary of Salesforce’s over-reliance on acquisition for growth. This is coupled with the fact that Slack has been underperforming its cloud peers during this work-from-home shift. For instance, Zoom’s Q3 revenue grew 365% while Slack’s grew a mere 39%. Video chat in Slack remains more basic than what rival Zoom has offered, limited to calls within an organization instead of letting a wider network of users jump on a virtual meeting.', '', '', 'Long-term outlook', '', 'Due to the lockdowns resulting from COVID-19, companies were forced to rapidly adapt overnight to be able to communicate remotely across all levels of a firm.

Using unified communication software, such as Slack and Microsoft Teams, firms adapted and found convenient ways to stay connected and on top of their business operations even when distantly separated. Aspects of remote work are likely to persist to a certain degree post-pandemic due to the convenience of messaging tools, as a survey conducted by RBC Capital Markets has shown that more than 40% of workers found workplace messaging tools as “absolutely critical” after COVID-19. Therefore, Salesforce’s long-term offering as an all-encompassing CRM provider will be significantly strengthened by their acquisition of Slack.

In turn, Slack’s acquisition will not only generate long-run revenue synergies for the company but also help Salesforce better compete with its major rival Microsoft."", '', 'Another benefit that the consolidation brings is that Slack can help Salesforce bring traction to other CRM products. Previously, Microsoft has used its Teams software to cross-promote other Office 365 products. Similarly, Salesforce can integrate Slack with its other softwares to create a more complete productivity suite for its users. This way, the company can cross-sell or upsell its existing cloud service products, which contributes to the company’s consistent goal of 25% year-on-year growth in revenue.

With the acquisitions of Slack in 2020, Tableau in 2019, and MuleSoft in 2018, Salesforce’s CEO Marc Benioff is attempting to transform the company into a “one-stop shop” for all business operations related to sales and marketing. Ultimately, buying Slack may prompt Salesforce to acquire other online collaborative products to complement Slack, such as Dropbox for better document management and RingCentral for better video conferencing. Moreover, the trend of acquisition in the industry will continue as other SaaS companies like SAP and Oracle may be urged to conduct more M&As so they can better compete and keep up with the trend in the industry.', ' ', '', 'Figure 6: Salesforce’s Major Acquisition Timeline (2016-2020)', '', 'Risks and Uncertainties', '', ""As far as internal uncertainties go, the board of directors of both companies have approved the transaction with the Slack board recommending that Slack stakeholders approve the transaction and adopt the merger agreement. However, UBS analysts argue that with Salesforce's massive value and size that development to Slack’s software would not be given proper attention, noting that they are “less and less clear about the direction that Salesforce is heading”. With the short term of the acquisition geared towards linking Slack into the Salesforce portfolio, some things that customers are looking forward to in the near future may not come to fruition, which could severely impact Slack’s performance. "", '', 'On the other hand, Slack could be a distraction for Salesforce management and could therefore not be believed to be the best owner for Slack. A much better suited one could argue could be Google or Amazon as they could integrate Slack into their platforms, but that would be unlikely due to antitrust regulations. Furthermore, Slack’s growth should be a risk for Salesforce. They have not turned a profit since their initial public offering last year. Since Slack is a SaaS valued at multiples of revenue instead of profits, their growth forecast faces immense pressure on its ability to materialize as earnings. This is concerning for Salesforce, who would be giving up nearly 13% of their market value for the acquisition based on Slack’s EV/Sales multiple seen in Figure 2.  Further, if Salesforce were to affect Slack’s internal operations through the acquisition, some existing customers may be turned away, as many customers now enjoy Slack for their simplicity and neutrality. Given the risks of the deal and Salesforce’s valuation of over $200 billion, analysts have suggested that their investors root for an antitrust review to prevent the deal.', '', 'Naturally, any deal of this size is subject to antitrust speculation. An antitrust debate has arisen after Slack has said that they cannot compete without a “defensive acquisition” despite saying they wanted to stay independent. This brings about a larger issue regarding a power disparity revolving mostly around Big Tech. Nonetheless, Salesforce is expected to be successful in its acquisition of Slack. It remains to be seen whether Slack will stay an independent entity after the acquisition as Salesforce has rebranded both Demandware and ExactTarget as Salesforce Commerce Cloud and Marketing Cloud respectively, yet allowed Tableau, MuleSoft, and Quip to keep their branding.

Spotify did so through “localization,” i.e. by tailoring their offerings to local tastes and adjusting their pricing to local expectations. Network effects have abetted Spotify’s international expansion, as the value of Spotify’s platform grows with every additional user and artist.

It is no wonder Spotify has made such a push to dominate the market. Podcasting revenue is expected to hit $1.1 billion in 2021; this growth will benefit the many publishers and advertising companies that take advantage of the acquisition between Spotify and Megaphone and their new ad based systems.

For those Americans that regularly listen to podcasts, the average listening time was 6 hours, 39 minutes. Advertising has also seen many benefits from the increased consumption of podcasts. Roughly 54% of podcasts listeners stated they were more likely to buy something from a brand after hearing its advertisement on a podcast. ', '', ""The introduction of dynamically targeted ads to the podcast industry could be pivotal for companies looking to accelerate advertising revenue. Roughly 90% of Spotify's revenue comes from its subscription service, however, new advertising technology could serve as a catalyst not only for Spotify but other streaming services as well. Spotify has placed an emphasis on audio services rather than strictly music services, a trend which will be replicated by companies like Apple, Amazon, and Google.

It is important to understand that Spotify continues to grow at a steady rate and therefore it must look for ways to innovate its service. Bring new features or further developing the podcast platform can help them maintain their advantage over Apple Music.', ' ', ' It is also important to highlight that Spotify has not quite yet established itself as the dominant company within the podcast industry.

However, “U.S. weekly podcast downloads were up 20% for the week ending April 19 compared to the first week of January, Podtrac said” (Lee,2020).

Indeed, the goal is to develop an international business support and capital raising platform for ambitious and fast growing companies, called ""ELITE"". Moreover, while Borsa’s bond trading platform MTS will give Euronext its first foray into fixed income trading, the french single order book will offer the Milan based stock exchange a unique gateway to investors in accessing the largest liquidity pool in Europe.

Refinitiv is a data provider, 45% owned by the parent company of Reuters News, Thomas Reuters Corp. The reason for the divestment of Borsa was to ease the concerns the European Commission has over LSE controlling the European bond market; there has been significant regulatory scrutiny over the proposed deal with Refinitiv. In fact, the transaction's completion depends upon European authorities allowing for the Refinitiv acquisition to go through. LSE has said they would have preferred to keep their Italian arm, but are reassured from the sale given they will make a considerable profit; the 2007 purchase of Borsa was for €1.6B.

Therefore, the agreed amount is a reasonable price for LSE considering the Italian business' skew to cash trading and clearing."", '', ""For Euronext, the acquisition of Borsa marks a turning point in their history. By welcoming the third-largest economy in Europe, Euronext can diversify their revenue streams and geographical footprint. The sale has opened the doors for them to build the leading pan-European market infrastructure as well as creating the backbone of the European capital markets union, according to Euronext CEO Stephane Boujnah. This new opportunity will be streamlined from the integration of MTS, Borsa's bond trading platform, which will enable Euronext to enter into fixed income trading for the first time. Rather than from job cuts, the purchase's synergies will most likely be coming from adopting Borsa's MTS technology platform. While the deal is requiring €1.8B in debt and €2.4B  in new equity in funding, the acquisition gives the French operator 25% of all equity trading in Europe and a clearinghouse for the first time.

Stéphane Boujnah, chief executive of Euronext, called the deal “a turning point in our group’s history”, stating that the transaction “will create the backbone of the Capital Markets Union in Europe”. Euronext’s acquisition of Borsa Italiana makes Italy the largest contributor to the group, reflecting the deals’ long-term strategic importance.', '', 'Involving Borsa Italiana in its transnational consortium of stock exchanges allows Euronext to expand its operations with respect to its tremendous reach and impact on European capital markets. Its venues would be home to a quarter of Europe’s €30bn-a-day trading in equities, reflecting the extensive consolidation and reach of Euronext’s products and platforms. The contribution of Italy as a G7 economy allows the group to build on existing structures in Dublin, Oslo, Paris and other European countries, expanding its network to more potential customers and adding to its over 1,463 listed companies. This will allow the group to further connect markets and allow easy-to-access opportunities for investors. After gaining access to the Italian market, this long-term positioning will allow Euronext to concentrate on expanding its product and platform diversity, while continuously adding depth to operations in Italy.', '', 'The deal gives Borsa Italiana a clearinghouse for the first time as well as a securities depository, stock exchange and bond platform. As a result, Euronext’s Mr. Boujnah also expressed that revenue synergies from the deal would mainly be achieved by moving Borsa Italiana to Euronext’s technology platform rather than through job cuts. Access to this technology platform will allow Borsa Italiana to benefit from a greater variety of products and new clients through faster and more digital processes. These long term revenue synergies are extended by creating a network of integrated platforms of transnationally connected stock exchanges, accumulating European investors on their platform. By fostering Italy’s market diversity in bond and equity markets, as well as giving access to new technology, Euronext’s transferred capabilities will allow Borsa Italiana to achieve long term growth within the firm and generate efficiencies for investors.', '', ""Finally, the deal contains essential impacts on Italy’s political and economic landscape. In the long run, involved stakeholders are hoping for the deal to contribute to the Italian economy by giving investors easier access to markets but also through political ties established for the transaction. Borsa Italiana is seen as a strategic asset in Italy because of its ownership of MTS SpA, a platform used to trade government bonds. While this made the deal politically sensitive, Euronext executed the transaction by teaming up with state agency Cassa Depositi e Prestiti (CDP) and Italy's biggest bank Intesa SanPaolo. Cooperating with central Italian financial institutions will add to Euronext’s powerful position in European markets and increase flexibility in its operations due to direct access to decision makers in the country. "", '', '', 'Barriers to the closure of the deal', '', 'A strong motivating factor behind LSE’s sale of Borsa Italiana is the desire to meet the anti-competition concerns of the E.U. ahead of their planned $27B acquisition of Refinitiv. However, if there are significant changes to LSE’s commitment to the deal, the Borsa Italiana sale may be in jeopardy. Included in the terms of the agreement is a contingency on the Refinitiv deal going through. Therefore, if LSE attempts to withdraw from the Refinitiv deal by citing any of the exit clauses in that contract, the Borsa Italiana deal would likely not go through.', '', 'LSE may also be forced to not go through with the acquisition if the commitments that the LSE group makes to address anti-competition concerns are not enough to satisfy the E.U. regulator. For instance, LSE recently had to make commitments to keep its trading business separate from its interest rate derivatives clearing business. If LSE is unable or unwilling to make further commitments to meet the demands of the E.U. regulator and abandons the Refinitiv deal, they could swiftly turn around and look for the legal remedies they have included in the Borsa Italiana sale agreement to walk away from the transaction. ', '', 'Further, other remedies to meet E.U. regulators’ demands may also be successful. If measures less severe than the sale of Borsa Italiana suffice, LSE may look for options to walk away from the deal. Recent threats by LVMH to walk away in their agreed deal to purchase Tiffany’s illustrate the extent to which deals that have already been agreed to can still be amended. LSE could potentially use better circumstances in their negotiations with regulators to keep a hold of the valuable Borsa Italiana asset. ', '', 'As part of the agreement, both companies LSE and Euronext had to gain shareholder approval of the deal. Results at LSE’s general meeting overwhelmingly supported the deal; 291,694,564 votes for and only 4,193 submitted against.

', '', 'Cloud Gaming 3-Phase Transmission', '', 'The transition to cloud gaming is occurring in real-time and is part of the 2 phases of gaming; digitalisation of gaming and cloud gaming transmission. Both transitions can be explained by explaining the changes in the customer journey and the hardware.', '', 'Firstly, came physical to digital media. This is due to 2 main points. Firstly, the changes in the customer journey of selecting a game from buying a physical disc from a store to downloading a game from the relevant virtual store. Secondly, came the changes in hardware to make them either physical and digital or digital solely compatible, thus pushing legacy gamers away from solely relying on physical game media. This is shown in Figure 2, with the movement from the Xbox 360 to the Xbox One series, with the Xbox One S being digital only. Currently, gaming is transitioning into cloud gaming. The change in the customer journey goes hand in hand with the change in hardware requirements. Often, gamers could only play games limited by the capacity of their own console/PC. With cloud gaming, any hardware shortfalls are eliminated as one essentially plays the game by streaming the outputs onto their device whilst simultaneously streaming back the game inputs to a data centre server. ', '', 'What this now means is that gamers can choose any game of their choosing in the knowledge that they now have the capacity to do so. Now with software innovations such as Xbox Game Pass and Playstation Now, gamers can purchase games and then stream the gaming experience onto their device. This has resulted in massive changes for the fourth generation of Xbox. The digital only console, Xbox Series S, is significantly smaller than the dual media Xbox Series X due to reduced levels of hardware. The Xbox Series S is designed specifically for cloud gaming as hardware is no longer a consideration and the lower cost of the console starts to push gamers towards this new model of gaming', '', 'Continued Growth in Cloud Gaming', '', 'The growth in the global cloud gaming is an upside for this acquisition. By removing the requirement for hardware, cloud gaming allows users to play on smart devices with high-speech Internet. Cloud gaming also lifts barriers for cost-conscious consumers, thereby attracting casual gamers into the market. Grand View Research reports that the cloud gaming market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 47.9% from 2020 to 2027. North America is expected to see the strongest growth in that period due to higher R&D investment in cloud computing, more widespread adoption of smartphones, and the presence of high-speed Internet. Asia, too, will see a significant growth in the coming decade due to a massive untapped gaming population and the recent penetration of smartphones. ', '', 'The rise of 5G in developed countries like the US and South Korea is expected to contribute to this growth, as mobile gaming has been limited thus far to low-spec games. Consumer bandwidth has been an impediment for streaming services and game operators alike, so the recent spread of 5G will revolutionize connectivity at users’ homes and maximize the potential of cloud gaming. 5G’s higher speeds and lower latencies are truly a game changer for cloud gaming, as they will enable mobile devices to support more complex games and accelerate the transition away from casual low-spec games. In fact, a recent poll from the Mobile Video Industry Council found that anywhere between 25 to 50% of 5G data traffic will come from cloud gaming by 2022. Operators like Playgiga and Hatch are already forming partnerships with cloud-gaming providers like AT&T and Sprint. Overall, the growth in cloud gaming and 5G will only complement Microsoft’s shift from a device-centric strategy towards a player-centric one. ', '', '', 'Long Term Outlook', '', 'Consolidation Trends - Focus on Contents - Game Publisher / Streaming Targets', '', 'To be a successful player in the gaming industry, companies need to have global cloud infrastructure, hardware capabilities (whether that be client consoles/PCs or data centres) and library of streamable games. There has been a trend of consolidation within the gaming industry particularly when considering cloud gaming and creative studios. Microsoft itself has a long history of acquiring creative studios to create content to suit their hardware whether that be Xbox One or Windows 10 PC gaming. For instance, Microsoft acquired Lionhead Studios to develop Fable Legends to suit their desires. Firstly, Lionhead optimised the game for Xbox One, then for DirectX12 graphics for Windows 10 PC gamers and then Xbox One and Windows 10 Crossplay capabilities.

Unlike other competitors, Apple Arcade does not require users to purchase individual games after they subscribed, which is like Netflix’s “one price for all” business model. However, Apple has a limited number of games and tends to not include console games. With a 46% smartphone market share in the United States and 13.5% globally, Apple’s addressable market is limited to Apple users, therefore the network effect may not be as profound as other competitors.', '', 'Potential Entry - Facebook ', '', 'Facebook Gaming has launched in 2017, it serves Discord and Twitch as a streaming platform for gamers to stream their plays on PC. However, outside of streaming itself, Facebook has dedicated a lot of effort into Oculus’ Virtual Reality (VR) gaming development.

Arm has licensing connections with the majority of companies that make mobile-device processors and other variations of chips, and many of these same companies are direct competitors with Nvidia or have the potential to be in the future. ', '', 'The regulatory approval process was fast in 2016 when SoftBank acquired Arm since the Japanese conglomerate was not directly competing with any of Arm’s clients. Even though Nvidia no longer develops smartphone chips, they are the world leader in graphic processing chips. Acquiring Arm gives them the potential to access the British company’s shipment volume and pricing information, so it wouldn’t be surprising if after the acquisition the company soon begins to develop products that would compete with Arm’s customer’s products. ', '', 'Another barrier to the global approval process is the escalating hostile relationship between the U.S. and China. Semiconductors have been caught in the middle of the trade and technology war between the two countries as the industry represents tech supremacy. The Nvidia-Arm deal is projected to have a very lengthy approval process; even Nvidia’s acquisition of Mellanox took over a year given its uncontroversial nature. ', '', 'Arm’s chips are the main structure for high-level electronics controlled by Big Tech and militaries, and the company coming into American control could create complications as the tech war heats up, especially as Beijing plans to halt foreign supply shipments. Long-term we could be witnessing more and more Chinese companies dissociate from Arm’s products to prevent their sensitive client data from being in the hands of the U.S. and to eliminate the fear of their supply being potentially cut-off one day. Nvidia reportedly does not expect exports to be an issue as Arm would continue to be headquartered in the U.K. ', '', 'Other than regulatory approval uncertainties, Hauser has been an outspoken opponent of the deal over fears that Nvidia would not keep their sizable workforce and R&D focused in their headquarters under the acquisition despite their promises. Currently, more than 3,000 employees are based in Britain but there are worries that the workforce will decrease in the future. Hauser expressed similar concerns over the SoftBank acquisition in 2016, but admits the company kept its promises to keep Cambridge as the main site of Arm’s research. Nvidia has stressed that they will keep the headquarters in Cambridge and invest in a new AI research center there. ', '', 'This $40B acquisition is not without several barriers to complete the deal and the risks posed to other firms are difficult to determine. While there is no conflict of interest as of now, the nature to which there will be in the future is unpredictable, but most definitely possible to be high. Nvidia will have to find the right balance between their own innovation and the work of Arm. Arm will ultimately need to be granted a level of independence to avoid government interjection and a loss of major clients to truly make their sizable investment worthwhile.

Although the deal is classified as a merger, it is essentially a takeover of Bankia by CaixaBank – they are 3x greater in market value and 2x as large in assets. As a result, other Spanish banks are growing keen on buying or joining rival banks to explore strategic options and be in a stronger position for cross-border deals. The merger also allows for CaixaBank to make significant annual cost cuts, resulting in increased revenue of about 1.1 billion (EUR). Together, the consolidated Spanish bank is expected to generate approximately 770 million (EUR) in cost synergies and within the next five years and is projected to reach an estimated annual revenue of 290 million (EUR).', ' ', 'The short-term consequences of the CaixaBank takeover are significant; there are a considerable number of job shutdowns and closing branches that come with the synergy. The main trade union Workers’ Commission (CCOO) has estimated over 51,000 staff to lose employment and approximately 6,300 branches to close in Spain. ', ' ', 'On the other hand, with the profitability of Spanish banks at risk due to low interest rates, subdued credit demand, and increased regulatory costs, the merger has allowed for CaixaBank to dramatically reduce overcapacity and increase profits. CaixaBank, with connections deep throughout a thriving Catalonia, will be able to broaden their presence into the nation’s large consumer and economic structure. In doing so, the Spanish banks will be able to cut off punitive competition and recover from their slowly diminishing profitability.', ' ', '“With this operation, we will form the principal Spanish franchise at a moment when it’s more necessary than ever to create entities with a critical size,” ', 'Goirigolzarri (Current President of Bankia)', '', '', 'Long-term consequences', '', 'This acquisition projects to be the beginning of what has been denominated “a new era in the Spanish banking sector”, as the Spanish banking industry looks to quickly consolidate in order to mitigate the adverse effects of the coronavirus pandemic. This, in fact, has been the decisive factor behind this merger, which was once before proposed in 2012 albeit with an unsuccessful outcome (the situation for the banks then was not as dire as the current one, with analysts describing the rationale behind this deal as a “question of survival”).', '', 'Amongst an agonizing Spanish economy, other banks will be looking to swiftly follow CaixaBank and Bankia’s footsteps. Rumours include Santander acquiring Bankinter or a BBVA merger with Banco Sabadell, as these entities hope to remain on top of their competition (before the merger, BBVA and Santander ranked first and second respectively amongst Spanish financial institutions, with both now trailing the post-merger CaixaBank in terms of assets and market share). Altogether these banks already comprise 72.4% of all financial assets held nationally, with these figures only looking to increase as the industry consolidates further.', '', 'Experts in fact consider larger national banks acquiring smaller entities to be but the onset of an increasing trend, and one that could expand well beyond international frontiers; with Spanish banks merging with those from other European nations such as Italy (where the sector is highly fragmented), France or Germany (where banks are facing similar profitability issues). Many believe this will lead to a wave of mergers that will leave behind a highly concentrated future banking sector; namely a “handful of big players”. These larger institutions would be better equipped to deal with the pressures of increasing delinquency, negative interest rates or the threats posed by fintech.', '', '', 'Risks and uncertainties', '', 'Barring any unforeseen issues, the merger should go ahead as planned and be completed by Q1 2021. Both institutions’ boards have approved of this deal, which is now only waiting to be sanctioned by the “Ministerio de Asuntos Económicos” and “Comisión Nacional de Los Mercados y la Competencia”. The presence of left-wing populist party “Podemos” in the governing coalition has given rise to rumours that they could resist the deal, but no real opposition is expected as the case for an oligopoly between CaixaBank and the other 4 big Spanish banks has already been debunked (the flow and rates of credit are not projected to be altered as a result of this or any future mergers, and they are in fact expected to become more competitive).', '', 'Instead, the main issue facing this merger at this stage (albeit not significant) will be the backlash at the prospective loss of employment; 30%-40% of Bankia’s offices expect to be closed, and 5,000-15,000 jobs are to be cut as a result of redundancies. The headquarters, however, will remain unchanged as both banks are based in the city of Valencia; CaixaBank moved its offices from Barcelona to Valencia following the civil unrest that gripped the city in 2017, as the massive protests for independence after an illegal referendum turned violent. Nonetheless, CaixaBank still retains significant influence in the Catalonia region; this alone should make the new entity into a Spanish banking powerhouse, ready to “rub shoulders with the largest European financial institutions”.', '', 'Another hot topic of debate around this merger has been how the Spanish government itself stands to benefit from this deal. This is because in 2012 the Spanish government bailed out Bankia as part of a €40 billion rescue package for the Spanish financial industry. This left them with a 60% stake in Bankia, (since then increased to 61.8%), a bank that had missed 3 straight deadlines (and by all means looking to miss a 4th one this January 2021) to take the company private and return the taxpayers’ money. Although in all likelihood this recouping of taxpayers’ funds still won’t take place after the merger, Luis de Guindos (ECB vice-president) has repeatedly defended bailing out Bankia, warning the “alternative would have been significantly more costly” and expressing hope that the merger might improve the situation. Moreover, after the merger, the State will see its stake diluted to a much more digestible 15% of a bank that looks to be more profitable than the weakened stand-alone Bankia. Consequently, the ECB and Banco de España have collectively voiced their approval of this deal, as the ECB actively encourages further consolidation of the European banking industry. This process is expected to take place “by stages”, with this merger seemingly being the first one.', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Oct 23, 2020', '6 min read', 'Sunrun acquires Vivint in all stock transaction valued at  $3.2 billion ', 'Sunrun acquires Vivint in all stock transaction valued at  $3.2 billion ', 'By Vadim Mandel (London School of Economics) ', 'By Vadim Mandel (London School of Economics) ', '', '', 'Overview of the Deal\xa0', 'Overview of the Deal\xa0', '', 'Sunrun (NYSE: RUN), America’s biggest rooftop- solar company has announced that it will be taking over rival Vivint Solar (VSLR) for $3.2bn in an all-stock transaction in one of the biggest deals in industry history expected to close in the 4th\xa0 quarter, pursuant to which each share of Vivint Solar common stock will be exchanged for 0.55 shares of Sunrun common stock, representing a combined\xa0 Enterprise Value of $9.2 billion.\xa0', 'Sunrun (NYSE: RUN), America’s biggest rooftop- solar company has announced', 'that it will be taking over rival Vivint Solar (VSLR) for $3.2bn in an ', 'transaction in one of the biggest deals in industry history expected to close in the 4th\xa0 quarter, pursuant to which each share of Vivint Solar common stock will be', 'exchanged for 0.55 shares of Sunrun common stock, representing a combined\xa0 Enterprise Value of $9.2 billion.\xa0', '', 'Vivint Solar stockholders are expected to own approximately 36% and Sunrun stockholders are expected to own approximately 64% of the fully diluted shares of the combined company.

Having made as many as 60 acquisitions over the years, six of which occurred in 2019, investors are wary of Salesforce’s over-reliance on acquisition for growth. This is coupled with the fact that Slack has been underperforming its cloud peers during this work-from-home shift. For instance, Zoom’s Q3 revenue grew 365% while Slack’s grew a mere 39%. Video chat in Slack remains more basic than what rival Zoom has offered, limited to calls within an organization instead of letting a wider network of users jump on a virtual meeting.', '', '', 'Long-term outlook', '', 'Due to the lockdowns resulting from COVID-19, companies were forced to rapidly adapt overnight to be able to communicate remotely across all levels of a firm.

Using unified communication software, such as Slack and Microsoft Teams, firms adapted and found convenient ways to stay connected and on top of their business operations even when distantly separated. Aspects of remote work are likely to persist to a certain degree post-pandemic due to the convenience of messaging tools, as a survey conducted by RBC Capital Markets has shown that more than 40% of workers found workplace messaging tools as “absolutely critical” after COVID-19.

In turn, Slack’s acquisition will not only generate long-run revenue synergies for the company but also help Salesforce better compete with its major rival Microsoft."", '', 'Another benefit that the consolidation brings is that Slack can help Salesforce bring traction to other CRM products. Previously, Microsoft has used its Teams software to cross-promote other Office 365 products. Similarly, Salesforce can integrate Slack with its other softwares to create a more complete productivity suite for its users. This way, the company can cross-sell or upsell its existing cloud service products, which contributes to the company’s consistent goal of 25% year-on-year growth in revenue.

With the acquisitions of Slack in 2020, Tableau in 2019, and MuleSoft in 2018, Salesforce’s CEO Marc Benioff is attempting to transform the company into a “one-stop shop” for all business operations related to sales and marketing. Ultimately, buying Slack may prompt Salesforce to acquire other online collaborative products to complement Slack, such as Dropbox for better document management and RingCentral for better video conferencing. Moreover, the trend of acquisition in the industry will continue as other SaaS companies like SAP and Oracle may be urged to conduct more M&As so they can better compete and keep up with the trend in the industry.', ' ', '', 'Figure 6: Salesforce’s Major Acquisition Timeline (2016-2020)', '', 'Risks and Uncertainties', '', ""As far as internal uncertainties go, the board of directors of both companies have approved the transaction with the Slack board recommending that Slack stakeholders approve the transaction and adopt the merger agreement. However, UBS analysts argue that with Salesforce's massive value and size that development to Slack’s software would not be given proper attention, noting that they are “less and less clear about the direction that Salesforce is heading”. With the short term of the acquisition geared towards linking Slack into the Salesforce portfolio, some things that customers are looking forward to in the near future may not come to fruition, which could severely impact Slack’s performance. "", '', 'On the other hand, Slack could be a distraction for Salesforce management and could therefore not be believed to be the best owner for Slack. A much better suited one could argue could be Google or Amazon as they could integrate Slack into their platforms, but that would be unlikely due to antitrust regulations. Furthermore, Slack’s growth should be a risk for Salesforce. They have not turned a profit since their initial public offering last year. Since Slack is a SaaS valued at multiples of revenue instead of profits, their growth forecast faces immense pressure on its ability to materialize as earnings. This is concerning for Salesforce, who would be giving up nearly 13% of their market value for the acquisition based on Slack’s EV/Sales multiple seen in Figure 2.  Further, if Salesforce were to affect Slack’s internal operations through the acquisition, some existing customers may be turned away, as many customers now enjoy Slack for their simplicity and neutrality. Given the risks of the deal and Salesforce’s valuation of over $200 billion, analysts have suggested that their investors root for an antitrust review to prevent the deal.', '', 'Naturally, any deal of this size is subject to antitrust speculation. An antitrust debate has arisen after Slack has said that they cannot compete without a “defensive acquisition” despite saying they wanted to stay independent. This brings about a larger issue regarding a power disparity revolving mostly around Big Tech. Nonetheless, Salesforce is expected to be successful in its acquisition of Slack. It remains to be seen whether Slack will stay an independent entity after the acquisition as Salesforce has rebranded both Demandware and ExactTarget as Salesforce Commerce Cloud and Marketing Cloud respectively, yet allowed Tableau, MuleSoft, and Quip to keep their branding.

In 2019, Spotify decided to double down in the podcast industry, with the acquisitions of Parcast and Anchor FM, to expand Spotify’s library of podcast offerings.', '', 'In 2020 February, Spotify acquired The Ringer, a sports & pop culture podcast network, to continue expanding its product offerings and make these podcasts only available on Spotify.

', '', '', 'Long Term Outlook - COVID Implications', '', 'As the Covid-19 pandemic continues, it is important to highlight the effects the lockdowns have had on podcast consumption. A great portion of the world population stayed home and did not commute to work. Initially, commuting was identified as the primary time frame for podcast listening and therefore, in its absence, experts believe the demand for podcasts would decrease. However, “U.S. weekly podcast downloads were up 20% for the week ending April 19 compared to the first week of January, Podtrac said” (Lee,2020). This can be attributed to the fact that individuals who stayed home had a surplus of time which they devoted listening to their favourite podcasts.', '', 'If we take a look at podcast producers, rather than listeners, it is also interesting to underline that Spotify is facilitating the production of podcasts so it can be a simple process carried out at home. In fact, “because podcasts can be produced remotely without crews, the pandemic has not disrupted Spotify’s slate of shows” (Lee, 2020).

Thus, it will be better positioned to deliver the ambition to further build the backbone of the Capital Markets Union in Europe. The combined group will operate exchanges with more than 1,800 listed companies and an aggregate market value of around €4.4 trillion. Moreover, it will be the main venue for secondary markets in Europe, with €11.7 billion worth of equities traded on a daily basis.

The comparable companies represent similar European exchange operators and similar business models. When also taking into consideration the control premium that Euronext has to pay in the deal, the price paid from this perspective seems very reasonable. However, when looking at only the EV/EBITDA multiple of competitors, Borsa Italiana’s estimated enterprise value is a far lower €3.6 billion, which would make the deal at a premium to its enterprise value. ', '', 'By combining their strong listing franchises, the two exchanges will facilitate access to equity financing for companies, strongly focusing on small and medium-sized enterprises (“SMEs”), family-owned and tech companies. Indeed, the goal is to develop an international business support and capital raising platform for ambitious and fast growing companies, called ""ELITE"". Moreover, while Borsa’s bond trading platform MTS will give Euronext its first foray into fixed income trading, the french single order book will offer the Milan based stock exchange a unique gateway to investors in accessing the largest liquidity pool in Europe. Moreover, the addition of Monte Titoli will more than double the size of Euronext’s CSD franchise, increasing assets under custody from €2.2 trillion to €5.6 trillion.', '', ""The deal is expected to enhance both companies' businesses across all their segments. This complementarity is expected to lead to greater benefits for investors, issuers and shareholders, creating a more comprehensive offering under a resilient business based on a strong core of services.

Moreover, it is expected to deliver double digit accretion including run-rate synergies in year 3. The € 4.325 million will be paid in cash to LSEG at closing. The financing is fully secured through a bridge loan facility, underwritten by a group of banks. It includes €300 million of use of existing cash, €1.8 billion of new debt as well as € 2.4 billion of new equity to be issued.

Refinitiv is a data provider, 45% owned by the parent company of Reuters News, Thomas Reuters Corp. The reason for the divestment of Borsa was to ease the concerns the European Commission has over LSE controlling the European bond market; there has been significant regulatory scrutiny over the proposed deal with Refinitiv. In fact, the transaction's completion depends upon European authorities allowing for the Refinitiv acquisition to go through. LSE has said they would have preferred to keep their Italian arm, but are reassured from the sale given they will make a considerable profit; the 2007 purchase of Borsa was for €1.6B. "", '', ' ""We believe the sale of the Borsa Italiana group will contribute significantly to addressing the EU\'s competition concerns.” ', ""said David Schwimmer, LSE's chief executive officer. "", '', ""The valuation— 16.7x EV/adjusted 2019 EBITDA — is around the average for global exchanges. Therefore, the agreed amount is a reasonable price for LSE considering the Italian business' skew to cash trading and clearing."", '', ""For Euronext, the acquisition of Borsa marks a turning point in their history. By welcoming the third-largest economy in Europe, Euronext can diversify their revenue streams and geographical footprint. The sale has opened the doors for them to build the leading pan-European market infrastructure as well as creating the backbone of the European capital markets union, according to Euronext CEO Stephane Boujnah. This new opportunity will be streamlined from the integration of MTS, Borsa's bond trading platform, which will enable Euronext to enter into fixed income trading for the first time. Rather than from job cuts, the purchase's synergies will most likely be coming from adopting Borsa's MTS technology platform. While the deal is requiring €1.8B in debt and €2.4B  in new equity in funding, the acquisition gives the French operator 25% of all equity trading in Europe and a clearinghouse for the first time. Euronext will also see an improvement in their equity operations, the joint group operating with more than 1,800 listed companies—an accumulated market value of around  €4.4T."", '', 'On the day the deal had been announced, October 9, shares in LSE rose 0.2% in early trading. The group’s shareholders are confident about their decision to sell Borsa since the deal will bring Refinitiv’s acquisition one step closer. On the same day, shares closed 0.4%. Euronext saw a 0.6% rise in their shares in early trading on the news of the deal as shareholders unanimously backed the deal. However, Euronext’s stock saw a decline of 4.4% at closing, which could suggest dissatisfaction by investors for Borsa.', '', 'Figure 3. Euronext Price Development (SeekingAlpha)', '', 'With high market volatility caused by rising COVID-19 cases across Europe and stricter lockdown measures, there have been sporadic decreases on the European markets (see Figure 3). On October 28 shares in both LSE and Euronext closed down by 6.2 and 9.9%, likely as a result.', '', '', 'Long-term outlook', '', 'Adding Borsa Italiana to its collection of European stock exchanges, Euronext expands its position as one of the most important owners of market infrastructure in Europe. Stéphane Boujnah, chief executive of Euronext, called the deal “a turning point in our group’s history”, stating that the transaction “will create the backbone of the Capital Markets Union in Europe”. Euronext’s acquisition of Borsa Italiana makes Italy the largest contributor to the group, reflecting the deals’ long-term strategic importance.', '', 'Involving Borsa Italiana in its transnational consortium of stock exchanges allows Euronext to expand its operations with respect to its tremendous reach and impact on European capital markets. Its venues would be home to a quarter of Europe’s €30bn-a-day trading in equities, reflecting the extensive consolidation and reach of Euronext’s products and platforms. The contribution of Italy as a G7 economy allows the group to build on existing structures in Dublin, Oslo, Paris and other European countries, expanding its network to more potential customers and adding to its over 1,463 listed companies. This will allow the group to further connect markets and allow easy-to-access opportunities for investors. After gaining access to the Italian market, this long-term positioning will allow Euronext to concentrate on expanding its product and platform diversity, while continuously adding depth to operations in Italy.', '', 'The deal gives Borsa Italiana a clearinghouse for the first time as well as a securities depository, stock exchange and bond platform. As a result, Euronext’s Mr. Boujnah also expressed that revenue synergies from the deal would mainly be achieved by moving Borsa Italiana to Euronext’s technology platform rather than through job cuts. Access to this technology platform will allow Borsa Italiana to benefit from a greater variety of products and new clients through faster and more digital processes. These long term revenue synergies are extended by creating a network of integrated platforms of transnationally connected stock exchanges, accumulating European investors on their platform. By fostering Italy’s market diversity in bond and equity markets, as well as giving access to new technology, Euronext’s transferred capabilities will allow Borsa Italiana to achieve long term growth within the firm and generate efficiencies for investors.', '', ""Finally, the deal contains essential impacts on Italy’s political and economic landscape. In the long run, involved stakeholders are hoping for the deal to contribute to the Italian economy by giving investors easier access to markets but also through political ties established for the transaction. Borsa Italiana is seen as a strategic asset in Italy because of its ownership of MTS SpA, a platform used to trade government bonds. While this made the deal politically sensitive, Euronext executed the transaction by teaming up with state agency Cassa Depositi e Prestiti (CDP) and Italy's biggest bank Intesa SanPaolo. Cooperating with central Italian financial institutions will add to Euronext’s powerful position in European markets and increase flexibility in its operations due to direct access to decision makers in the country. "", '', '', 'Barriers to the closure of the deal', '', 'A strong motivating factor behind LSE’s sale of Borsa Italiana is the desire to meet the anti-competition concerns of the E.U. ahead of their planned $27B acquisition of Refinitiv. However, if there are significant changes to LSE’s commitment to the deal, the Borsa Italiana sale may be in jeopardy. Included in the terms of the agreement is a contingency on the Refinitiv deal going through. Therefore, if LSE attempts to withdraw from the Refinitiv deal by citing any of the exit clauses in that contract, the Borsa Italiana deal would likely not go through.', '', 'LSE may also be forced to not go through with the acquisition if the commitments that the LSE group makes to address anti-competition concerns are not enough to satisfy the E.U. regulator. For instance, LSE recently had to make commitments to keep its trading business separate from its interest rate derivatives clearing business. If LSE is unable or unwilling to make further commitments to meet the demands of the E.U. regulator and abandons the Refinitiv deal, they could swiftly turn around and look for the legal remedies they have included in the Borsa Italiana sale agreement to walk away from the transaction. ', '', 'Further, other remedies to meet E.U. regulators’ demands may also be successful. If measures less severe than the sale of Borsa Italiana suffice, LSE may look for options to walk away from the deal. Recent threats by LVMH to walk away in their agreed deal to purchase Tiffany’s illustrate the extent to which deals that have already been agreed to can still be amended. LSE could potentially use better circumstances in their negotiations with regulators to keep a hold of the valuable Borsa Italiana asset. ', '', 'As part of the agreement, both companies LSE and Euronext had to gain shareholder approval of the deal. Results at LSE’s general meeting overwhelmingly supported the deal; 291,694,564 votes for and only 4,193 submitted against. This is likely due to the appeal of the Refinitiv transaction, which is contingent on this sale.

', '', 'Cloud Gaming 3-Phase Transmission', '', 'The transition to cloud gaming is occurring in real-time and is part of the 2 phases of gaming; digitalisation of gaming and cloud gaming transmission. Both transitions can be explained by explaining the changes in the customer journey and the hardware.', '', 'Firstly, came physical to digital media. This is due to 2 main points. Firstly, the changes in the customer journey of selecting a game from buying a physical disc from a store to downloading a game from the relevant virtual store. Secondly, came the changes in hardware to make them either physical and digital or digital solely compatible, thus pushing legacy gamers away from solely relying on physical game media. This is shown in Figure 2, with the movement from the Xbox 360 to the Xbox One series, with the Xbox One S being digital only. Currently, gaming is transitioning into cloud gaming. The change in the customer journey goes hand in hand with the change in hardware requirements. Often, gamers could only play games limited by the capacity of their own console/PC. With cloud gaming, any hardware shortfalls are eliminated as one essentially plays the game by streaming the outputs onto their device whilst simultaneously streaming back the game inputs to a data centre server. ', '', 'What this now means is that gamers can choose any game of their choosing in the knowledge that they now have the capacity to do so. Now with software innovations such as Xbox Game Pass and Playstation Now, gamers can purchase games and then stream the gaming experience onto their device. This has resulted in massive changes for the fourth generation of Xbox. The digital only console, Xbox Series S, is significantly smaller than the dual media Xbox Series X due to reduced levels of hardware. The Xbox Series S is designed specifically for cloud gaming as hardware is no longer a consideration and the lower cost of the console starts to push gamers towards this new model of gaming', '', 'Continued Growth in Cloud Gaming', '', 'The growth in the global cloud gaming is an upside for this acquisition. By removing the requirement for hardware, cloud gaming allows users to play on smart devices with high-speech Internet. Cloud gaming also lifts barriers for cost-conscious consumers, thereby attracting casual gamers into the market. Grand View Research reports that the cloud gaming market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 47.9% from 2020 to 2027. North America is expected to see the strongest growth in that period due to higher R&D investment in cloud computing, more widespread adoption of smartphones, and the presence of high-speed Internet. Asia, too, will see a significant growth in the coming decade due to a massive untapped gaming population and the recent penetration of smartphones. ', '', 'The rise of 5G in developed countries like the US and South Korea is expected to contribute to this growth, as mobile gaming has been limited thus far to low-spec games. Consumer bandwidth has been an impediment for streaming services and game operators alike, so the recent spread of 5G will revolutionize connectivity at users’ homes and maximize the potential of cloud gaming. 5G’s higher speeds and lower latencies are truly a game changer for cloud gaming, as they will enable mobile devices to support more complex games and accelerate the transition away from casual low-spec games. In fact, a recent poll from the Mobile Video Industry Council found that anywhere between 25 to 50% of 5G data traffic will come from cloud gaming by 2022. Operators like Playgiga and Hatch are already forming partnerships with cloud-gaming providers like AT&T and Sprint. Overall, the growth in cloud gaming and 5G will only complement Microsoft’s shift from a device-centric strategy towards a player-centric one.

There has been a trend of consolidation within the gaming industry particularly when considering cloud gaming and creative studios. Microsoft itself has a long history of acquiring creative studios to create content to suit their hardware whether that be Xbox One or Windows 10 PC gaming. For instance, Microsoft acquired Lionhead Studios to develop Fable Legends to suit their desires. Firstly, Lionhead optimised the game for Xbox One, then for DirectX12 graphics for Windows 10 PC gamers and then Xbox One and Windows 10 Crossplay capabilities. Larger companies want to differentiate themselves with their game offerings by utilizing the creative talents of indie and smaller game developers (to attract prospective gamers) while also ensuring the content is compatible and promotes their own existing software and hardware.

Unlike other competitors, Apple Arcade does not require users to purchase individual games after they subscribed, which is like Netflix’s “one price for all” business model. However, Apple has a limited number of games and tends to not include console games. With a 46% smartphone market share in the United States and 13.5% globally, Apple’s addressable market is limited to Apple users, therefore the network effect may not be as profound as other competitors.', '', 'Potential Entry - Facebook ', '', 'Facebook Gaming has launched in 2017, it serves Discord and Twitch as a streaming platform for gamers to stream their plays on PC. However, outside of streaming itself, Facebook has dedicated a lot of effort into Oculus’ Virtual Reality (VR) gaming development. Even though Facebook does not own any data centres that would support cloud gaming logistically, Facebook’s leading edge VR development could pose threats to Microsoft if VR gaming continues to cannibalize cloud or digital gaming segments.', '', 'Conclusion', '', 'Despite the cloud gaming space requiring significant barriers to entry, it has attracted most big technology companies to compete in the space because of its explosive growth opportunities in platform growth, traffic exposure and income opportunities.

Although the deal is classified as a merger, it is essentially a takeover of Bankia by CaixaBank – they are 3x greater in market value and 2x as large in assets. As a result, other Spanish banks are growing keen on buying or joining rival banks to explore strategic options and be in a stronger position for cross-border deals. The merger also allows for CaixaBank to make significant annual cost cuts, resulting in increased revenue of about 1.1 billion (EUR). Together, the consolidated Spanish bank is expected to generate approximately 770 million (EUR) in cost synergies and within the next five years and is projected to reach an estimated annual revenue of 290 million (EUR).', ' ', 'The short-term consequences of the CaixaBank takeover are significant; there are a considerable number of job shutdowns and closing branches that come with the synergy. The main trade union Workers’ Commission (CCOO) has estimated over 51,000 staff to lose employment and approximately 6,300 branches to close in Spain. ', ' ', 'On the other hand, with the profitability of Spanish banks at risk due to low interest rates, subdued credit demand, and increased regulatory costs, the merger has allowed for CaixaBank to dramatically reduce overcapacity and increase profits. CaixaBank, with connections deep throughout a thriving Catalonia, will be able to broaden their presence into the nation’s large consumer and economic structure. In doing so, the Spanish banks will be able to cut off punitive competition and recover from their slowly diminishing profitability.', ' ', '“With this operation, we will form the principal Spanish franchise at a moment when it’s more necessary than ever to create entities with a critical size,” ', 'Goirigolzarri (Current President of Bankia)', '', '', 'Long-term consequences', '', 'This acquisition projects to be the beginning of what has been denominated “a new era in the Spanish banking sector”, as the Spanish banking industry looks to quickly consolidate in order to mitigate the adverse effects of the coronavirus pandemic. This, in fact, has been the decisive factor behind this merger, which was once before proposed in 2012 albeit with an unsuccessful outcome (the situation for the banks then was not as dire as the current one, with analysts describing the rationale behind this deal as a “question of survival”).', '', 'Amongst an agonizing Spanish economy, other banks will be looking to swiftly follow CaixaBank and Bankia’s footsteps. Rumours include Santander acquiring Bankinter or a BBVA merger with Banco Sabadell, as these entities hope to remain on top of their competition (before the merger, BBVA and Santander ranked first and second respectively amongst Spanish financial institutions, with both now trailing the post-merger CaixaBank in terms of assets and market share). Altogether these banks already comprise 72.4% of all financial assets held nationally, with these figures only looking to increase as the industry consolidates further.', '', 'Experts in fact consider larger national banks acquiring smaller entities to be but the onset of an increasing trend, and one that could expand well beyond international frontiers; with Spanish banks merging with those from other European nations such as Italy (where the sector is highly fragmented), France or Germany (where banks are facing similar profitability issues). Many believe this will lead to a wave of mergers that will leave behind a highly concentrated future banking sector; namely a “handful of big players”. These larger institutions would be better equipped to deal with the pressures of increasing delinquency, negative interest rates or the threats posed by fintech.', '', '', 'Risks and uncertainties', '', 'Barring any unforeseen issues, the merger should go ahead as planned and be completed by Q1 2021. Both institutions’ boards have approved of this deal, which is now only waiting to be sanctioned by the “Ministerio de Asuntos Económicos” and “Comisión Nacional de Los Mercados y la Competencia”. The presence of left-wing populist party “Podemos” in the governing coalition has given rise to rumours that they could resist the deal, but no real opposition is expected as the case for an oligopoly between CaixaBank and the other 4 big Spanish banks has already been debunked (the flow and rates of credit are not projected to be altered as a result of this or any future mergers, and they are in fact expected to become more competitive).', '', 'Instead, the main issue facing this merger at this stage (albeit not significant) will be the backlash at the prospective loss of employment; 30%-40% of Bankia’s offices expect to be closed, and 5,000-15,000 jobs are to be cut as a result of redundancies. The headquarters, however, will remain unchanged as both banks are based in the city of Valencia; CaixaBank moved its offices from Barcelona to Valencia following the civil unrest that gripped the city in 2017, as the massive protests for independence after an illegal referendum turned violent. Nonetheless, CaixaBank still retains significant influence in the Catalonia region; this alone should make the new entity into a Spanish banking powerhouse, ready to “rub shoulders with the largest European financial institutions”.', '', 'Another hot topic of debate around this merger has been how the Spanish government itself stands to benefit from this deal. This is because in 2012 the Spanish government bailed out Bankia as part of a €40 billion rescue package for the Spanish financial industry. This left them with a 60% stake in Bankia, (since then increased to 61.8%), a bank that had missed 3 straight deadlines (and by all means looking to miss a 4th one this January 2021) to take the company private and return the taxpayers’ money. Although in all likelihood this recouping of taxpayers’ funds still won’t take place after the merger, Luis de Guindos (ECB vice-president) has repeatedly defended bailing out Bankia, warning the “alternative would have been significantly more costly” and expressing hope that the merger might improve the situation. Moreover, after the merger, the State will see its stake diluted to a much more digestible 15% of a bank that looks to be more profitable than the weakened stand-alone Bankia. Consequently, the ECB and Banco de España have collectively voiced their approval of this deal, as the ECB actively encourages further consolidation of the European banking industry. This process is expected to take place “by stages”, with this merger seemingly being the first one.', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Oct 23, 2020', '6 min read', 'Sunrun acquires Vivint in all stock transaction valued at  $3.2 billion ', 'Sunrun acquires Vivint in all stock transaction valued at  $3.2 billion ', 'By Vadim Mandel (London School of Economics) ', 'By Vadim Mandel (London School of Economics) ', '', '', 'Overview of the Deal\xa0', 'Overview of the Deal\xa0', '', 'Sunrun (NYSE: RUN), America’s biggest rooftop- solar company has announced that it will be taking over rival Vivint Solar (VSLR) for $3.2bn in an all-stock transaction in one of the biggest deals in industry history expected to close in the 4th\xa0 quarter, pursuant to which each share of Vivint Solar common stock will be exchanged for 0.55 shares of Sunrun common stock, representing a combined\xa0 Enterprise Value of $9.2 billion.\xa0', 'Sunrun (NYSE: RUN), America’s biggest rooftop- solar company has announced', 'that it will be taking over rival Vivint Solar (VSLR) for $3.2bn in an ', 'transaction in one of the biggest deals in industry history expected to close in the 4th\xa0 quarter, pursuant to which each share of Vivint Solar common stock will be', 'exchanged for 0.55 shares of Sunrun common stock, representing a combined\xa0 Enterprise Value of $9.2 billion.\xa0', '', 'Vivint Solar stockholders are expected to own approximately 36% and Sunrun stockholders are expected to own approximately 64% of the fully diluted shares of the combined company.

Furthermore, Slack’s growth should be a risk for Salesforce. They have not turned a profit since their initial public offering last year. Since Slack is a SaaS valued at multiples of revenue instead of profits, their growth forecast faces immense pressure on its ability to materialize as earnings. This is concerning for Salesforce, who would be giving up nearly 13% of their market value for the acquisition based on Slack’s EV/Sales multiple seen in Figure 2.  Further, if Salesforce were to affect Slack’s internal operations through the acquisition, some existing customers may be turned away, as many customers now enjoy Slack for their simplicity and neutrality. Given the risks of the deal and Salesforce’s valuation of over $200 billion, analysts have suggested that their investors root for an antitrust review to prevent the deal.', '', 'Naturally, any deal of this size is subject to antitrust speculation. An antitrust debate has arisen after Slack has said that they cannot compete without a “defensive acquisition” despite saying they wanted to stay independent. This brings about a larger issue regarding a power disparity revolving mostly around Big Tech. Nonetheless, Salesforce is expected to be successful in its acquisition of Slack.

Therefore, the agreed amount is a reasonable price for LSE considering the Italian business' skew to cash trading and clearing."", '', ""For Euronext, the acquisition of Borsa marks a turning point in their history. By welcoming the third-largest economy in Europe, Euronext can diversify their revenue streams and geographical footprint. The sale has opened the doors for them to build the leading pan-European market infrastructure as well as creating the backbone of the European capital markets union, according to Euronext CEO Stephane Boujnah. This new opportunity will be streamlined from the integration of MTS, Borsa's bond trading platform, which will enable Euronext to enter into fixed income trading for the first time. Rather than from job cuts, the purchase's synergies will most likely be coming from adopting Borsa's MTS technology platform. While the deal is requiring €1.8B in debt and €2.4B  in new equity in funding, the acquisition gives the French operator 25% of all equity trading in Europe and a clearinghouse for the first time. Euronext will also see an improvement in their equity operations, the joint group operating with more than 1,800 listed companies—an accumulated market value of around  €4.4T."", '', 'On the day the deal had been announced, October 9, shares in LSE rose 0.2% in early trading. The group’s shareholders are confident about their decision to sell Borsa since the deal will bring Refinitiv’s acquisition one step closer. On the same day, shares closed 0.4%. Euronext saw a 0.6% rise in their shares in early trading on the news of the deal as shareholders unanimously backed the deal. However, Euronext’s stock saw a decline of 4.4% at closing, which could suggest dissatisfaction by investors for Borsa.', '', 'Figure 3. Euronext Price Development (SeekingAlpha)', '', 'With high market volatility caused by rising COVID-19 cases across Europe and stricter lockdown measures, there have been sporadic decreases on the European markets (see Figure 3). On October 28 shares in both LSE and Euronext closed down by 6.2 and 9.9%, likely as a result.', '', '', 'Long-term outlook', '', 'Adding Borsa Italiana to its collection of European stock exchanges, Euronext expands its position as one of the most important owners of market infrastructure in Europe. Stéphane Boujnah, chief executive of Euronext, called the deal “a turning point in our group’s history”, stating that the transaction “will create the backbone of the Capital Markets Union in Europe”. Euronext’s acquisition of Borsa Italiana makes Italy the largest contributor to the group, reflecting the deals’ long-term strategic importance.', '', 'Involving Borsa Italiana in its transnational consortium of stock exchanges allows Euronext to expand its operations with respect to its tremendous reach and impact on European capital markets. Its venues would be home to a quarter of Europe’s €30bn-a-day trading in equities, reflecting the extensive consolidation and reach of Euronext’s products and platforms. The contribution of Italy as a G7 economy allows the group to build on existing structures in Dublin, Oslo, Paris and other European countries, expanding its network to more potential customers and adding to its over 1,463 listed companies. This will allow the group to further connect markets and allow easy-to-access opportunities for investors. After gaining access to the Italian market, this long-term positioning will allow Euronext to concentrate on expanding its product and platform diversity, while continuously adding depth to operations in Italy.', '', 'The deal gives Borsa Italiana a clearinghouse for the first time as well as a securities depository, stock exchange and bond platform. As a result, Euronext’s Mr. Boujnah also expressed that revenue synergies from the deal would mainly be achieved by moving Borsa Italiana to Euronext’s technology platform rather than through job cuts. Access to this technology platform will allow Borsa Italiana to benefit from a greater variety of products and new clients through faster and more digital processes. These long term revenue synergies are extended by creating a network of integrated platforms of transnationally connected stock exchanges, accumulating European investors on their platform. By fostering Italy’s market diversity in bond and equity markets, as well as giving access to new technology, Euronext’s transferred capabilities will allow Borsa Italiana to achieve long term growth within the firm and generate efficiencies for investors.', '', ""Finally, the deal contains essential impacts on Italy’s political and economic landscape. In the long run, involved stakeholders are hoping for the deal to contribute to the Italian economy by giving investors easier access to markets but also through political ties established for the transaction. Borsa Italiana is seen as a strategic asset in Italy because of its ownership of MTS SpA, a platform used to trade government bonds. While this made the deal politically sensitive, Euronext executed the transaction by teaming up with state agency Cassa Depositi e Prestiti (CDP) and Italy's biggest bank Intesa SanPaolo. Cooperating with central Italian financial institutions will add to Euronext’s powerful position in European markets and increase flexibility in its operations due to direct access to decision makers in the country. "", '', '', 'Barriers to the closure of the deal', '', 'A strong motivating factor behind LSE’s sale of Borsa Italiana is the desire to meet the anti-competition concerns of the E.U. ahead of their planned $27B acquisition of Refinitiv. However, if there are significant changes to LSE’s commitment to the deal, the Borsa Italiana sale may be in jeopardy. Included in the terms of the agreement is a contingency on the Refinitiv deal going through. Therefore, if LSE attempts to withdraw from the Refinitiv deal by citing any of the exit clauses in that contract, the Borsa Italiana deal would likely not go through.', '', 'LSE may also be forced to not go through with the acquisition if the commitments that the LSE group makes to address anti-competition concerns are not enough to satisfy the E.U. regulator. For instance, LSE recently had to make commitments to keep its trading business separate from its interest rate derivatives clearing business. If LSE is unable or unwilling to make further commitments to meet the demands of the E.U. regulator and abandons the Refinitiv deal, they could swiftly turn around and look for the legal remedies they have included in the Borsa Italiana sale agreement to walk away from the transaction. ', '', 'Further, other remedies to meet E.U. regulators’ demands may also be successful. If measures less severe than the sale of Borsa Italiana suffice, LSE may look for options to walk away from the deal. Recent threats by LVMH to walk away in their agreed deal to purchase Tiffany’s illustrate the extent to which deals that have already been agreed to can still be amended. LSE could potentially use better circumstances in their negotiations with regulators to keep a hold of the valuable Borsa Italiana asset. ', '', 'As part of the agreement, both companies LSE and Euronext had to gain shareholder approval of the deal. Results at LSE’s general meeting overwhelmingly supported the deal; 291,694,564 votes for and only 4,193 submitted against. This is likely due to the appeal of the Refinitiv transaction, which is contingent on this sale.

Microsoft's acquisition of Zenimax places pressures on Sony because games such as Deathloop and Ghostwire were supposed to be exclusively for PS5. Not only does this force Sony to pay down the line if they’d like to continue to offer these titles, but this can effectively sway consumers. By offering Zenimax titles to Xbox Game Pass, Microsoft looks to lead console sales this holiday season with a stronger game catalogue with titles such as Outer Worlds and Gears 5.

', '', 'Cloud Gaming 3-Phase Transmission', '', 'The transition to cloud gaming is occurring in real-time and is part of the 2 phases of gaming; digitalisation of gaming and cloud gaming transmission. Both transitions can be explained by explaining the changes in the customer journey and the hardware.', '', 'Firstly, came physical to digital media. This is due to 2 main points. Firstly, the changes in the customer journey of selecting a game from buying a physical disc from a store to downloading a game from the relevant virtual store. Secondly, came the changes in hardware to make them either physical and digital or digital solely compatible, thus pushing legacy gamers away from solely relying on physical game media. This is shown in Figure 2, with the movement from the Xbox 360 to the Xbox One series, with the Xbox One S being digital only. Currently, gaming is transitioning into cloud gaming. The change in the customer journey goes hand in hand with the change in hardware requirements. Often, gamers could only play games limited by the capacity of their own console/PC. With cloud gaming, any hardware shortfalls are eliminated as one essentially plays the game by streaming the outputs onto their device whilst simultaneously streaming back the game inputs to a data centre server. ', '', 'What this now means is that gamers can choose any game of their choosing in the knowledge that they now have the capacity to do so. Now with software innovations such as Xbox Game Pass and Playstation Now, gamers can purchase games and then stream the gaming experience onto their device. This has resulted in massive changes for the fourth generation of Xbox. The digital only console, Xbox Series S, is significantly smaller than the dual media Xbox Series X due to reduced levels of hardware. The Xbox Series S is designed specifically for cloud gaming as hardware is no longer a consideration and the lower cost of the console starts to push gamers towards this new model of gaming', '', 'Continued Growth in Cloud Gaming', '', 'The growth in the global cloud gaming is an upside for this acquisition. By removing the requirement for hardware, cloud gaming allows users to play on smart devices with high-speech Internet. Cloud gaming also lifts barriers for cost-conscious consumers, thereby attracting casual gamers into the market. Grand View Research reports that the cloud gaming market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 47.9% from 2020 to 2027. North America is expected to see the strongest growth in that period due to higher R&D investment in cloud computing, more widespread adoption of smartphones, and the presence of high-speed Internet. Asia, too, will see a significant growth in the coming decade due to a massive untapped gaming population and the recent penetration of smartphones. ', '', 'The rise of 5G in developed countries like the US and South Korea is expected to contribute to this growth, as mobile gaming has been limited thus far to low-spec games. Consumer bandwidth has been an impediment for streaming services and game operators alike, so the recent spread of 5G will revolutionize connectivity at users’ homes and maximize the potential of cloud gaming. 5G’s higher speeds and lower latencies are truly a game changer for cloud gaming, as they will enable mobile devices to support more complex games and accelerate the transition away from casual low-spec games. In fact, a recent poll from the Mobile Video Industry Council found that anywhere between 25 to 50% of 5G data traffic will come from cloud gaming by 2022. Operators like Playgiga and Hatch are already forming partnerships with cloud-gaming providers like AT&T and Sprint. Overall, the growth in cloud gaming and 5G will only complement Microsoft’s shift from a device-centric strategy towards a player-centric one.

There has been a trend of consolidation within the gaming industry particularly when considering cloud gaming and creative studios. Microsoft itself has a long history of acquiring creative studios to create content to suit their hardware whether that be Xbox One or Windows 10 PC gaming. For instance, Microsoft acquired Lionhead Studios to develop Fable Legends to suit their desires. Firstly, Lionhead optimised the game for Xbox One, then for DirectX12 graphics for Windows 10 PC gamers and then Xbox One and Windows 10 Crossplay capabilities. Larger companies want to differentiate themselves with their game offerings by utilizing the creative talents of indie and smaller game developers (to attract prospective gamers) while also ensuring the content is compatible and promotes their own existing software and hardware. Hardware is another area where it is very plausible to see consolidation.

Unlike other competitors, Apple Arcade does not require users to purchase individual games after they subscribed, which is like Netflix’s “one price for all” business model. However, Apple has a limited number of games and tends to not include console games. With a 46% smartphone market share in the United States and 13.5% globally, Apple’s addressable market is limited to Apple users, therefore the network effect may not be as profound as other competitors.', '', 'Potential Entry - Facebook ', '', 'Facebook Gaming has launched in 2017, it serves Discord and Twitch as a streaming platform for gamers to stream their plays on PC. However, outside of streaming itself, Facebook has dedicated a lot of effort into Oculus’ Virtual Reality (VR) gaming development. Even though Facebook does not own any data centres that would support cloud gaming logistically, Facebook’s leading edge VR development could pose threats to Microsoft if VR gaming continues to cannibalize cloud or digital gaming segments.', '', 'Conclusion', '', 'Despite the cloud gaming space requiring significant barriers to entry, it has attracted most big technology companies to compete in the space because of its explosive growth opportunities in platform growth, traffic exposure and income opportunities.

Nonetheless, CaixaBank still retains significant influence in the Catalonia region; this alone should make the new entity into a Spanish banking powerhouse, ready to “rub shoulders with the largest European financial institutions”.', '', 'Another hot topic of debate around this merger has been how the Spanish government itself stands to benefit from this deal. This is because in 2012 the Spanish government bailed out Bankia as part of a €40 billion rescue package for the Spanish financial industry. This left them with a 60% stake in Bankia, (since then increased to 61.8%), a bank that had missed 3 straight deadlines (and by all means looking to miss a 4th one this January 2021) to take the company private and return the taxpayers’ money. Although in all likelihood this recouping of taxpayers’ funds still won’t take place after the merger, Luis de Guindos (ECB vice-president) has repeatedly defended bailing out Bankia, warning the “alternative would have been significantly more costly” and expressing hope that the merger might improve the situation. Moreover, after the merger, the State will see its stake diluted to a much more digestible 15% of a bank that looks to be more profitable than the weakened stand-alone Bankia. Consequently, the ECB and Banco de España have collectively voiced their approval of this deal, as the ECB actively encourages further consolidation of the European banking industry. This process is expected to take place “by stages”, with this merger seemingly being the first one.', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Oct 23, 2020', '6 min read', 'Sunrun acquires Vivint in all stock transaction valued at  $3.2 billion ', 'Sunrun acquires Vivint in all stock transaction valued at  $3.2 billion ', 'By Vadim Mandel (London School of Economics) ', 'By Vadim Mandel (London School of Economics) ', '', '', 'Overview of the Deal\xa0', 'Overview of the Deal\xa0', '', 'Sunrun (NYSE: RUN), America’s biggest rooftop- solar company has announced that it will be taking over rival Vivint Solar (VSLR) for $3.2bn in an all-stock transaction in one of the biggest deals in industry history expected to close in the 4th\xa0 quarter, pursuant to which each share of Vivint Solar common stock will be exchanged for 0.55 shares of Sunrun common stock, representing a combined\xa0 Enterprise Value of $9.2 billion.\xa0', 'Sunrun (NYSE: RUN), America’s biggest rooftop- solar company has announced', 'that it will be taking over rival Vivint Solar (VSLR) for $3.2bn in an ', 'transaction in one of the biggest deals in industry history expected to close in the 4th\xa0 quarter, pursuant to which each share of Vivint Solar common stock will be', 'exchanged for 0.55 shares of Sunrun common stock, representing a combined\xa0 Enterprise Value of $9.2 billion.\xa0', '', 'Vivint Solar stockholders are expected to own approximately 36% and Sunrun stockholders are expected to own approximately 64% of the fully diluted shares of the combined company.

The transaction will raise Salesforce's adjusted leverage from zero to the 1x area upon close, well below the downgrade trigger of 2x."", '', 'The acquisition has however been met with mixed reactions from its investors. Salesforce’s stock plunged on Dec 2, 2020 by 8.9% despite the announcement of positive income growth. Investors are mainly worried about the hefty price tag of $27.7B for Slack, which represents a 54% premium to its unaffected price or 26x forward sales. Having made as many as 60 acquisitions over the years, six of which occurred in 2019, investors are wary of Salesforce’s over-reliance on acquisition for growth. This is coupled with the fact that Slack has been underperforming its cloud peers during this work-from-home shift. For instance, Zoom’s Q3 revenue grew 365% while Slack’s grew a mere 39%. Video chat in Slack remains more basic than what rival Zoom has offered, limited to calls within an organization instead of letting a wider network of users jump on a virtual meeting.', '', '', 'Long-term outlook', '', 'Due to the lockdowns resulting from COVID-19, companies were forced to rapidly adapt overnight to be able to communicate remotely across all levels of a firm. During the pandemic, many companies were forced to move towards remote work operations. Using unified communication software, such as Slack and Microsoft Teams, firms adapted and found convenient ways to stay connected and on top of their business operations even when distantly separated. Aspects of remote work are likely to persist to a certain degree post-pandemic due to the convenience of messaging tools, as a survey conducted by RBC Capital Markets has shown that more than 40% of workers found workplace messaging tools as “absolutely critical” after COVID-19. Therefore, Salesforce’s long-term offering as an all-encompassing CRM provider will be significantly strengthened by their acquisition of Slack. ', '', 'Figure 5: Survey Result: Worker’s Opinion on Workplace Messaging Tools (Source)', '', ""In addition, after losing a bid against its competitor Microsoft to acquire LinkedIn in 2016, Salesforce aims to get back at Microsoft by making the acquisition of Slack. This move by Salesforce poses a great threat to Microsoft as Slack's usage hits the heart of Microsoft's most central products of its productivity suite, Microsoft Teams. In turn, Slack’s acquisition will not only generate long-run revenue synergies for the company but also help Salesforce better compete with its major rival Microsoft."", '', 'Another benefit that the consolidation brings is that Slack can help Salesforce bring traction to other CRM products. Previously, Microsoft has used its Teams software to cross-promote other Office 365 products. Similarly, Salesforce can integrate Slack with its other softwares to create a more complete productivity suite for its users. This way, the company can cross-sell or upsell its existing cloud service products, which contributes to the company’s consistent goal of 25% year-on-year growth in revenue. ', ' ', 'The acquisition of Slack contributes to the trend of M&A in the cloud software industry. With the acquisitions of Slack in 2020, Tableau in 2019, and MuleSoft in 2018, Salesforce’s CEO Marc Benioff is attempting to transform the company into a “one-stop shop” for all business operations related to sales and marketing. Ultimately, buying Slack may prompt Salesforce to acquire other online collaborative products to complement Slack, such as Dropbox for better document management and RingCentral for better video conferencing. Moreover, the trend of acquisition in the industry will continue as other SaaS companies like SAP and Oracle may be urged to conduct more M&As so they can better compete and keep up with the trend in the industry.', ' ', '', 'Figure 6: Salesforce’s Major Acquisition Timeline (2016-2020)', '', 'Risks and Uncertainties', '', ""As far as internal uncertainties go, the board of directors of both companies have approved the transaction with the Slack board recommending that Slack stakeholders approve the transaction and adopt the merger agreement. However, UBS analysts argue that with Salesforce's massive value and size that development to Slack’s software would not be given proper attention, noting that they are “less and less clear about the direction that Salesforce is heading”. With the short term of the acquisition geared towards linking Slack into the Salesforce portfolio, some things that customers are looking forward to in the near future may not come to fruition, which could severely impact Slack’s performance. "", '', 'On the other hand, Slack could be a distraction for Salesforce management and could therefore not be believed to be the best owner for Slack. A much better suited one could argue could be Google or Amazon as they could integrate Slack into their platforms, but that would be unlikely due to antitrust regulations. Furthermore, Slack’s growth should be a risk for Salesforce. They have not turned a profit since their initial public offering last year. Since Slack is a SaaS valued at multiples of revenue instead of profits, their growth forecast faces immense pressure on its ability to materialize as earnings. This is concerning for Salesforce, who would be giving up nearly 13% of their market value for the acquisition based on Slack’s EV/Sales multiple seen in Figure 2.  Further, if Salesforce were to affect Slack’s internal operations through the acquisition, some existing customers may be turned away, as many customers now enjoy Slack for their simplicity and neutrality. Given the risks of the deal and Salesforce’s valuation of over $200 billion, analysts have suggested that their investors root for an antitrust review to prevent the deal.', '', 'Naturally, any deal of this size is subject to antitrust speculation. An antitrust debate has arisen after Slack has said that they cannot compete without a “defensive acquisition” despite saying they wanted to stay independent. This brings about a larger issue regarding a power disparity revolving mostly around Big Tech. Nonetheless, Salesforce is expected to be successful in its acquisition of Slack. It remains to be seen whether Slack will stay an independent entity after the acquisition as Salesforce has rebranded both Demandware and ExactTarget as Salesforce Commerce Cloud and Marketing Cloud respectively, yet allowed Tableau, MuleSoft, and Quip to keep their branding.

In 2019, Spotify decided to double down in the podcast industry, with the acquisitions of Parcast and Anchor FM, to expand Spotify’s library of podcast offerings.', '', 'In 2020 February, Spotify acquired The Ringer, a sports & pop culture podcast network, to continue expanding its product offerings and make these podcasts only available on Spotify.

If measures less severe than the sale of Borsa Italiana suffice, LSE may look for options to walk away from the deal. Recent threats by LVMH to walk away in their agreed deal to purchase Tiffany’s illustrate the extent to which deals that have already been agreed to can still be amended. LSE could potentially use better circumstances in their negotiations with regulators to keep a hold of the valuable Borsa Italiana asset.

This shift in focus has led to major consolidation in the industry. Xbox has always lacked exclusive titles compared to Sony, until last year when they surpassed Sony’s 14 gaming studios. Microsoft has led the industry in acquisitions, now controlling 23 studios compared to Sony’s 17. They now control Fallout, Doom, Elder Scrolls, and Quake. By controlling these titles Microsoft is able to make them exclusive and offer them on Xbox Game Pass. This acquisition comes as the new Xbox is being released to further incentivize consumers in an effort to disrupt Sony’s Playstation market share. ', '', 'Zenimax Rationale ', '', 'One of Zenimax’s key pain points in the past few years has been monetizing their games. In fact, Zenimax has struggled to achieve the right balance between quality and price in their games, with some of their recent games especially falling flat. With Microsoft supplying the capital for future projects, the Bethesda team will be able to focus more on ideation and innovation rather than cost and profit considerations. Peter Hines, the SVP of Global Marketing at Bethesda, explained the acquisition as a means for Zenimax to gain “access to resources that will make us a better publisher and developer.” ', '', 'Moreover, Zenimax will benefit from broader distribution, as its fans will now be able to access all of Bethesda’s games through the Xbox Game Pass. Likewise, Microsoft’s Xbox has long lagged behind Sony’s more exclusive and high-quality games, so Xbox users will likewise benefit from premier gaming titles like The Elder Scrolls and Wolfenstein (See Figure 1).

However, it will join XBox’s studios and share their resources such as Xbox’s mass distribution channel. Strategically, Microsoft will be able to vertically integrate by saving the licensing fees and result in higher gross margins when rolling-out their games to the broader market. ', '', 'Market Share Growth', '', ""With 2.7 billion people projected to play games this year and sales to exceed $160B Microsoft looks to continue to grow their market share by expanding their gaming portfolio. Microsoft's acquisition of Zenimax places pressures on Sony because games such as Deathloop and Ghostwire were supposed to be exclusively for PS5. Not only does this force Sony to pay down the line if they’d like to continue to offer these titles, but this can effectively sway consumers. By offering Zenimax titles to Xbox Game Pass, Microsoft looks to lead console sales this holiday season with a stronger game catalogue with titles such as Outer Worlds and Gears 5.

First, Playstation’s (Sony) cloud gaming service, Playstation Now, will not be supported under Microsoft’s Azure cloud infrastructure, allowing quicker delivery and higher quality. Secondly, Sony’s cutting-edge image sensors technology will further complement Microsoft’s Azure AI technology in AI experiences (In-Game Action Preciseness, Controller Settings).

', '', 'Cloud Gaming 3-Phase Transmission', '', 'The transition to cloud gaming is occurring in real-time and is part of the 2 phases of gaming; digitalisation of gaming and cloud gaming transmission. Both transitions can be explained by explaining the changes in the customer journey and the hardware.', '', 'Firstly, came physical to digital media. This is due to 2 main points. Firstly, the changes in the customer journey of selecting a game from buying a physical disc from a store to downloading a game from the relevant virtual store. Secondly, came the changes in hardware to make them either physical and digital or digital solely compatible, thus pushing legacy gamers away from solely relying on physical game media. This is shown in Figure 2, with the movement from the Xbox 360 to the Xbox One series, with the Xbox One S being digital only. Currently, gaming is transitioning into cloud gaming. The change in the customer journey goes hand in hand with the change in hardware requirements. Often, gamers could only play games limited by the capacity of their own console/PC. With cloud gaming, any hardware shortfalls are eliminated as one essentially plays the game by streaming the outputs onto their device whilst simultaneously streaming back the game inputs to a data centre server. ', '', 'What this now means is that gamers can choose any game of their choosing in the knowledge that they now have the capacity to do so. Now with software innovations such as Xbox Game Pass and Playstation Now, gamers can purchase games and then stream the gaming experience onto their device. This has resulted in massive changes for the fourth generation of Xbox. The digital only console, Xbox Series S, is significantly smaller than the dual media Xbox Series X due to reduced levels of hardware. The Xbox Series S is designed specifically for cloud gaming as hardware is no longer a consideration and the lower cost of the console starts to push gamers towards this new model of gaming', '', 'Continued Growth in Cloud Gaming', '', 'The growth in the global cloud gaming is an upside for this acquisition. By removing the requirement for hardware, cloud gaming allows users to play on smart devices with high-speech Internet. Cloud gaming also lifts barriers for cost-conscious consumers, thereby attracting casual gamers into the market. Grand View Research reports that the cloud gaming market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 47.9% from 2020 to 2027. North America is expected to see the strongest growth in that period due to higher R&D investment in cloud computing, more widespread adoption of smartphones, and the presence of high-speed Internet. Asia, too, will see a significant growth in the coming decade due to a massive untapped gaming population and the recent penetration of smartphones. ', '', 'The rise of 5G in developed countries like the US and South Korea is expected to contribute to this growth, as mobile gaming has been limited thus far to low-spec games. Consumer bandwidth has been an impediment for streaming services and game operators alike, so the recent spread of 5G will revolutionize connectivity at users’ homes and maximize the potential of cloud gaming. 5G’s higher speeds and lower latencies are truly a game changer for cloud gaming, as they will enable mobile devices to support more complex games and accelerate the transition away from casual low-spec games. In fact, a recent poll from the Mobile Video Industry Council found that anywhere between 25 to 50% of 5G data traffic will come from cloud gaming by 2022.

There has been a trend of consolidation within the gaming industry particularly when considering cloud gaming and creative studios. Microsoft itself has a long history of acquiring creative studios to create content to suit their hardware whether that be Xbox One or Windows 10 PC gaming. For instance, Microsoft acquired Lionhead Studios to develop Fable Legends to suit their desires. Firstly, Lionhead optimised the game for Xbox One, then for DirectX12 graphics for Windows 10 PC gamers and then Xbox One and Windows 10 Crossplay capabilities. Larger companies want to differentiate themselves with their game offerings by utilizing the creative talents of indie and smaller game developers (to attract prospective gamers) while also ensuring the content is compatible and promotes their own existing software and hardware.

Under Nvidia’s current business, the company focuses on its leading AI computing platform and ability to create datacenters and high-performance platforms. However, the company has been unable to move into the space of creating their own central processing unit (CPU) chip, which is used across all electronic computing devices, and has forced customers to look elsewhere to fill this need. Instead, Nvidia has used its abilities to create graphic enhancing chips such as its successful GeForce RTX series. ', '', 'Although with Arm now under Nvidia’s wing, the company has the potential to finally fill this gap since Arm has been expanding its presence to include the creation of chip designs and technologies that are used in central processors. While Arm’s chips alone haven’t been able to compete with those produced by industry leaders such as Intel or AMD, the combination of Arm’s chip-making ability and network with Nvidia’s experience in graphic enhancers and AI platforms could revolutionize the industry by giving Nvidia control of all necessary components.

The headquarters, however, will remain unchanged as both banks are based in the city of Valencia; CaixaBank moved its offices from Barcelona to Valencia following the civil unrest that gripped the city in 2017, as the massive protests for independence after an illegal referendum turned violent.

Moreover, after the merger, the State will see its stake diluted to a much more digestible 15% of a bank that looks to be more profitable than the weakened stand-alone Bankia.

This represents a year-on-year increase of approximately 21%, maintaining the company’s sales growth that has hovered around 26% in the past 5 years.', '', ""Immediate impacts on its capital structure are cushioned by Salesforce’s considerable cash balance.

The company's nearly $9.5B cash balance should decline upon close of the transaction, based on its estimated $7B cash outflow for the acquisition. Cash should quickly be replenished through strong free operating cash flow generation, which management has expected will exceed $4B in FY21 and FY22. The transaction will raise Salesforce's adjusted leverage from zero to the 1x area upon close, well below the downgrade trigger of 2x."", '', 'The acquisition has however been met with mixed reactions from its investors. Salesforce’s stock plunged on Dec 2, 2020 by 8.9% despite the announcement of positive income growth. Investors are mainly worried about the hefty price tag of $27.7B for Slack, which represents a 54% premium to its unaffected price or 26x forward sales. Having made as many as 60 acquisitions over the years, six of which occurred in 2019, investors are wary of Salesforce’s over-reliance on acquisition for growth. This is coupled with the fact that Slack has been underperforming its cloud peers during this work-from-home shift. For instance, Zoom’s Q3 revenue grew 365% while Slack’s grew a mere 39%. Video chat in Slack remains more basic than what rival Zoom has offered, limited to calls within an organization instead of letting a wider network of users jump on a virtual meeting.', '', '', 'Long-term outlook', '', 'Due to the lockdowns resulting from COVID-19, companies were forced to rapidly adapt overnight to be able to communicate remotely across all levels of a firm. During the pandemic, many companies were forced to move towards remote work operations. Using unified communication software, such as Slack and Microsoft Teams, firms adapted and found convenient ways to stay connected and on top of their business operations even when distantly separated. Aspects of remote work are likely to persist to a certain degree post-pandemic due to the convenience of messaging tools, as a survey conducted by RBC Capital Markets has shown that more than 40% of workers found workplace messaging tools as “absolutely critical” after COVID-19. Therefore, Salesforce’s long-term offering as an all-encompassing CRM provider will be significantly strengthened by their acquisition of Slack.

This move by Salesforce poses a great threat to Microsoft as Slack's usage hits the heart of Microsoft's most central products of its productivity suite, Microsoft Teams. In turn, Slack’s acquisition will not only generate long-run revenue synergies for the company but also help Salesforce better compete with its major rival Microsoft."", '', 'Another benefit that the consolidation brings is that Slack can help Salesforce bring traction to other CRM products. Previously, Microsoft has used its Teams software to cross-promote other Office 365 products. Similarly, Salesforce can integrate Slack with its other softwares to create a more complete productivity suite for its users. This way, the company can cross-sell or upsell its existing cloud service products, which contributes to the company’s consistent goal of 25% year-on-year growth in revenue. ', ' ', 'The acquisition of Slack contributes to the trend of M&A in the cloud software industry. With the acquisitions of Slack in 2020, Tableau in 2019, and MuleSoft in 2018, Salesforce’s CEO Marc Benioff is attempting to transform the company into a “one-stop shop” for all business operations related to sales and marketing. Ultimately, buying Slack may prompt Salesforce to acquire other online collaborative products to complement Slack, such as Dropbox for better document management and RingCentral for better video conferencing. Moreover, the trend of acquisition in the industry will continue as other SaaS companies like SAP and Oracle may be urged to conduct more M&As so they can better compete and keep up with the trend in the industry.', ' ', '', 'Figure 6: Salesforce’s Major Acquisition Timeline (2016-2020)', '', 'Risks and Uncertainties', '', ""As far as internal uncertainties go, the board of directors of both companies have approved the transaction with the Slack board recommending that Slack stakeholders approve the transaction and adopt the merger agreement. However, UBS analysts argue that with Salesforce's massive value and size that development to Slack’s software would not be given proper attention, noting that they are “less and less clear about the direction that Salesforce is heading”. With the short term of the acquisition geared towards linking Slack into the Salesforce portfolio, some things that customers are looking forward to in the near future may not come to fruition, which could severely impact Slack’s performance. "", '', 'On the other hand, Slack could be a distraction for Salesforce management and could therefore not be believed to be the best owner for Slack. A much better suited one could argue could be Google or Amazon as they could integrate Slack into their platforms, but that would be unlikely due to antitrust regulations. Furthermore, Slack’s growth should be a risk for Salesforce. They have not turned a profit since their initial public offering last year. Since Slack is a SaaS valued at multiples of revenue instead of profits, their growth forecast faces immense pressure on its ability to materialize as earnings. This is concerning for Salesforce, who would be giving up nearly 13% of their market value for the acquisition based on Slack’s EV/Sales multiple seen in Figure 2.  Further, if Salesforce were to affect Slack’s internal operations through the acquisition, some existing customers may be turned away, as many customers now enjoy Slack for their simplicity and neutrality. Given the risks of the deal and Salesforce’s valuation of over $200 billion, analysts have suggested that their investors root for an antitrust review to prevent the deal.', '', 'Naturally, any deal of this size is subject to antitrust speculation. An antitrust debate has arisen after Slack has said that they cannot compete without a “defensive acquisition” despite saying they wanted to stay independent. This brings about a larger issue regarding a power disparity revolving mostly around Big Tech. Nonetheless, Salesforce is expected to be successful in its acquisition of Slack. It remains to be seen whether Slack will stay an independent entity after the acquisition as Salesforce has rebranded both Demandware and ExactTarget as Salesforce Commerce Cloud and Marketing Cloud respectively, yet allowed Tableau, MuleSoft, and Quip to keep their branding.

This seems to be the next piece of the puzzle from turning into the dominant player to the podcast world.  Spotify has already acquired Gimlet Media, a podcast network, and a podcast creation app, Anchor. The acquisition of Megaphone is in the light of a Q3 2019 earning call where Daniel Ek, the CEO of Spotify commented that ‘monetization of podcasts .. is something that we’re going to start looking at in 2020.’ This deal is aimed at penetrating the podcast ad market through the power of the Megaphone Targeted Marketplace and Spotify’s Streaming Ad Insertion service.', '', '', 'Megaphone Business Model', '', 'Megaphone is an end-to-end platform manager for creators to publish, monetize, and measure their podcasts with its user-friendly product surface (See Exhibit 1).

Podcasts Ads operating on Megaphone are populated upon podcast download, the messaging is personalized according to the listener’s profile (i.e. age, nationality, gender) and listening habits (frequency, podcast choices, first/frequent listener, etc). As a result, creators are enabled to benefit from more efficient ad targeting executions. ', '', '', 'Deal Rationale', '', 'Megaphone’s hosting platform is the biggest value-add to Spotify, as it will now be able to scale and monetize its SAI technology. Introduced only earlier this year, Spotify’s proprietary SAI technology allows it to optimize the ads that users hear in each podcast based on their geolocation, age, music preferences, podcast listening history, Spotify friends, and other data. Jason Richman, Spotify’s VP of Global Advertising Business and Platform, explained that the acquisition was ultimately “a big play for scale.” Spotify can now roll out its advertising optimization software across a broader portfolio of podcasts and generate higher returns on the advertiser front. From a competitive standpoint, the acquisition will further increase the profit potential for advertisers and cement Spotify as the podcast service of choice. ', '', 'Seller Rationale: Larger Distribution Channel', '', 'Partnering with Spotify allows Megaphone to reach a larger audience and expand upon creators’ already impressive offering of shows and podcasts. Namely, Spotify will offer its unique “Streaming Ad Insertion” to podcast publishers utilizing Megaphone’s services. Additionally, Spotify boasts more than a million podcasts on the app. Megaphone will not have to worry as much about marketing and outreach now that they have access to myriad shows. Without having to worry about distribution, Megaphone can spend more of its time working on its services and offerings. ', '', 'The acquisition will undoubtedly pressure other companies to offer a certain level of flexibility in terms of advertising and publishing. As Spotify podcast publishers can now decide how their podcasts are monetized, it incentivizes new publishers to distribute their podcast and advertisers to target specific niches on Spotify. ', '', '', 'ShortTerm Outlook ', '', 'In the short run, the acquisition will allow Spotify to scale and monetize SAI by bringing to more than 20,000 publishers on Megaphone’s platform. Thus far, SAI has been a premium, niche product, and the advertiser demand has outstripped Spotify’s inventory. Megaphone will allow Spotify to fill the gap and use the size of Spotify’s and Megaphone’s combined audience to attract new consumer advertisers. Moreover, the acquisition will further solidify Spotify’s position as the premier end-to-end solution for podcast creators. From Megaphone’s advanced video editing tools and volume forecasting software to Spotify’s trademark SAI technology, the broad podcast creation toolkit will now be centralized under the Spotify brand.

Spotify’s historical acquisition focus is on developing its core music streaming service by increasingly investing in data-driven music discovery techniques with the acquisition of Tunigo in 2014 and Sonalytic in 2017, and Spotify’s cutting-edge, targeted music recommendation algorithm with the acquisition of Niland. In 2019, Spotify decided to double down in the podcast industry, with the acquisitions of Parcast and Anchor FM, to expand Spotify’s library of podcast offerings.', '', 'In 2020 February, Spotify acquired The Ringer, a sports & pop culture podcast network, to continue expanding its product offerings and make these podcasts only available on Spotify. As the podcast industry continues to get competitive, Spotify is likely to continue its acquisition strategy to expand its podcast platform and integrate SAI tools within podcast publishers.', '', 'In addition, Spotify has conducted strategic partnerships with Joe Rogan, Michelle Obama, and Kim Kardashian West with exclusive streaming licenses, marking Spotify’s intention to expand its audio library beyond music. ', '', 'Spotify has come to dominate the music streaming industry since its launch in 2008 through three key growth strategies: cost leadership, market development, and market penetration. ', '', 'For one, Spotify is a cost leader in that its ad-based business model supports a broad base of free users, who have access to radio-style streaming. Second, Spotify has developed the market demand for music streaming through tactical brand-name partnerships. ', 'Back in 2010, for example, Spotify partnered with Facebook to allow its users to send songs to their friends through the social media platform. More recently, Spotify and Hulu announced a joint plan in 2018 to allow customers to access both services for $12.99 per month; for reference, Spotify Premium costs $9.99 per month, while Hulu’s is $7.99. In 2019, Spotify expanded its reach by partnering with Amazon to stream its free music service on Alexa devices. These partnerships and joint ventures have allowed Spotify to increase exposure via different content platforms to capture market share. ', '', 'Spotify’s third growth strategy is market penetration. By 2016, Spotify had conquered six unique country markets in Asia, despite the idiosyncrasy of each one. Spotify did so through “localization,” i.e. by tailoring their offerings to local tastes and adjusting their pricing to local expectations. Network effects have abetted Spotify’s international expansion, as the value of Spotify’s platform grows with every additional user and artist. Meanwhile, its economies of scale have increased profitability, as its growing brand value and increasingly large user base have decreased fixed costs per customer over time.

The entire industry has seen a phenomenal increase in demand. This growth is expected to result in 131 million monthly users by 2024. It is no wonder Spotify has made such a push to dominate the market. Podcasting revenue is expected to hit $1.1 billion in 2021; this growth will benefit the many publishers and advertising companies that take advantage of the acquisition between Spotify and Megaphone and their new ad based systems.

For those Americans that regularly listen to podcasts, the average listening time was 6 hours, 39 minutes. Advertising has also seen many benefits from the increased consumption of podcasts. Roughly 54% of podcasts listeners stated they were more likely to buy something from a brand after hearing its advertisement on a podcast. ', '', ""The introduction of dynamically targeted ads to the podcast industry could be pivotal for companies looking to accelerate advertising revenue. Roughly 90% of Spotify's revenue comes from its subscription service, however, new advertising technology could serve as a catalyst not only for Spotify but other streaming services as well. Spotify has placed an emphasis on audio services rather than strictly music services, a trend which will be replicated by companies like Apple, Amazon, and Google. "", '', 'In the future, podcast publishers will begin to expect more flexibility in their capabilities. This includes “the opportunity to opt-in to have their content monetized, matching their listeners with even greater demand from advertisers.” This flexibility will be expected from other streaming services as well, and if it is not met, Spotify can expect to absorb those publishers.

As COVID-19 subsides, consumer consumption will increase as well, as individuals commute and travel, and those who started listening to podcasts during quarantine continue. Apple currently maintains roughly 19% of the user market with Spotify at 30%. The competition will be fierce as streaming services look to make acquisitions in order to maintain their place within the market.

As of the first quarter of 2020, Spotify remains at arm’s length of its fiercest competitor, Apple Music, which recorded a little over half the number of paid memberships to its services in comparison to Spotify. Furthermore, if we observe other metrics, we will see that Spotify remains ahead on all fronts. ', '', 'In a statement released by Spotify they disclosed that “relative to Apple, the publicly available data shows that our monthly engagement is roughly 2x as high and our churn is at half the rate” (Spotify, 2019). It is important to understand that Spotify continues to grow at a steady rate and therefore it must look for ways to innovate its service. Bring new features or further developing the podcast platform can help them maintain their advantage over Apple Music.', ' ', ' It is also important to highlight that Spotify has not quite yet established itself as the dominant company within the podcast industry. Yes, on a larger scale, it is competing with Apple Music, but in the podcast industry, it still faces fierce competition from companies. As a matter of fact, “Spotify isn’t the only company hoping that its exclusive podcasts will compel listeners to pay for access.

A great portion of the world population stayed home and did not commute to work. Initially, commuting was identified as the primary time frame for podcast listening and therefore, in its absence, experts believe the demand for podcasts would decrease. However, “U.S. weekly podcast downloads were up 20% for the week ending April 19 compared to the first week of January, Podtrac said” (Lee,2020). This can be attributed to the fact that individuals who stayed home had a surplus of time which they devoted listening to their favourite podcasts.', '', 'If we take a look at podcast producers, rather than listeners, it is also interesting to underline that Spotify is facilitating the production of podcasts so it can be a simple process carried out at home. In fact, “because podcasts can be produced remotely without crews, the pandemic has not disrupted Spotify’s slate of shows” (Lee, 2020).

As a result, Euronext’s Mr. Boujnah also expressed that revenue synergies from the deal would mainly be achieved by moving Borsa Italiana to Euronext’s technology platform rather than through job cuts. Access to this technology platform will allow Borsa Italiana to benefit from a greater variety of products and new clients through faster and more digital processes. These long term revenue synergies are extended by creating a network of integrated platforms of transnationally connected stock exchanges, accumulating European investors on their platform. By fostering Italy’s market diversity in bond and equity markets, as well as giving access to new technology, Euronext’s transferred capabilities will allow Borsa Italiana to achieve long term growth within the firm and generate efficiencies for investors.', '', ""Finally, the deal contains essential impacts on Italy’s political and economic landscape. In the long run, involved stakeholders are hoping for the deal to contribute to the Italian economy by giving investors easier access to markets but also through political ties established for the transaction. Borsa Italiana is seen as a strategic asset in Italy because of its ownership of MTS SpA, a platform used to trade government bonds. While this made the deal politically sensitive, Euronext executed the transaction by teaming up with state agency Cassa Depositi e Prestiti (CDP) and Italy's biggest bank Intesa SanPaolo. Cooperating with central Italian financial institutions will add to Euronext’s powerful position in European markets and increase flexibility in its operations due to direct access to decision makers in the country. "", '', '', 'Barriers to the closure of the deal', '', 'A strong motivating factor behind LSE’s sale of Borsa Italiana is the desire to meet the anti-competition concerns of the E.U. ahead of their planned $27B acquisition of Refinitiv. However, if there are significant changes to LSE’s commitment to the deal, the Borsa Italiana sale may be in jeopardy. Included in the terms of the agreement is a contingency on the Refinitiv deal going through. Therefore, if LSE attempts to withdraw from the Refinitiv deal by citing any of the exit clauses in that contract, the Borsa Italiana deal would likely not go through.', '', 'LSE may also be forced to not go through with the acquisition if the commitments that the LSE group makes to address anti-competition concerns are not enough to satisfy the E.U. regulator. For instance, LSE recently had to make commitments to keep its trading business separate from its interest rate derivatives clearing business. If LSE is unable or unwilling to make further commitments to meet the demands of the E.U. regulator and abandons the Refinitiv deal, they could swiftly turn around and look for the legal remedies they have included in the Borsa Italiana sale agreement to walk away from the transaction. ', '', 'Further, other remedies to meet E.U. regulators’ demands may also be successful. If measures less severe than the sale of Borsa Italiana suffice, LSE may look for options to walk away from the deal. Recent threats by LVMH to walk away in their agreed deal to purchase Tiffany’s illustrate the extent to which deals that have already been agreed to can still be amended. LSE could potentially use better circumstances in their negotiations with regulators to keep a hold of the valuable Borsa Italiana asset.

Results at LSE’s general meeting overwhelmingly supported the deal; 291,694,564 votes for and only 4,193 submitted against.

Microsoft has led the industry in acquisitions, now controlling 23 studios compared to Sony’s 17. They now control Fallout, Doom, Elder Scrolls, and Quake. By controlling these titles Microsoft is able to make them exclusive and offer them on Xbox Game Pass. This acquisition comes as the new Xbox is being released to further incentivize consumers in an effort to disrupt Sony’s Playstation market share. ', '', 'Zenimax Rationale ', '', 'One of Zenimax’s key pain points in the past few years has been monetizing their games. In fact, Zenimax has struggled to achieve the right balance between quality and price in their games, with some of their recent games especially falling flat.

', '', 'Market Share Growth', '', ""With 2.7 billion people projected to play games this year and sales to exceed $160B Microsoft looks to continue to grow their market share by expanding their gaming portfolio. Microsoft's acquisition of Zenimax places pressures on Sony because games such as Deathloop and Ghostwire were supposed to be exclusively for PS5. Not only does this force Sony to pay down the line if they’d like to continue to offer these titles, but this can effectively sway consumers.

', '', 'Cloud Gaming 3-Phase Transmission', '', 'The transition to cloud gaming is occurring in real-time and is part of the 2 phases of gaming; digitalisation of gaming and cloud gaming transmission. Both transitions can be explained by explaining the changes in the customer journey and the hardware.', '', 'Firstly, came physical to digital media. This is due to 2 main points. Firstly, the changes in the customer journey of selecting a game from buying a physical disc from a store to downloading a game from the relevant virtual store. Secondly, came the changes in hardware to make them either physical and digital or digital solely compatible, thus pushing legacy gamers away from solely relying on physical game media. This is shown in Figure 2, with the movement from the Xbox 360 to the Xbox One series, with the Xbox One S being digital only. Currently, gaming is transitioning into cloud gaming. The change in the customer journey goes hand in hand with the change in hardware requirements. Often, gamers could only play games limited by the capacity of their own console/PC. With cloud gaming, any hardware shortfalls are eliminated as one essentially plays the game by streaming the outputs onto their device whilst simultaneously streaming back the game inputs to a data centre server. ', '', 'What this now means is that gamers can choose any game of their choosing in the knowledge that they now have the capacity to do so. Now with software innovations such as Xbox Game Pass and Playstation Now, gamers can purchase games and then stream the gaming experience onto their device. This has resulted in massive changes for the fourth generation of Xbox. The digital only console, Xbox Series S, is significantly smaller than the dual media Xbox Series X due to reduced levels of hardware. The Xbox Series S is designed specifically for cloud gaming as hardware is no longer a consideration and the lower cost of the console starts to push gamers towards this new model of gaming', '', 'Continued Growth in Cloud Gaming', '', 'The growth in the global cloud gaming is an upside for this acquisition. By removing the requirement for hardware, cloud gaming allows users to play on smart devices with high-speech Internet. Cloud gaming also lifts barriers for cost-conscious consumers, thereby attracting casual gamers into the market. Grand View Research reports that the cloud gaming market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 47.9% from 2020 to 2027. North America is expected to see the strongest growth in that period due to higher R&D investment in cloud computing, more widespread adoption of smartphones, and the presence of high-speed Internet. Asia, too, will see a significant growth in the coming decade due to a massive untapped gaming population and the recent penetration of smartphones. ', '', 'The rise of 5G in developed countries like the US and South Korea is expected to contribute to this growth, as mobile gaming has been limited thus far to low-spec games. Consumer bandwidth has been an impediment for streaming services and game operators alike, so the recent spread of 5G will revolutionize connectivity at users’ homes and maximize the potential of cloud gaming. 5G’s higher speeds and lower latencies are truly a game changer for cloud gaming, as they will enable mobile devices to support more complex games and accelerate the transition away from casual low-spec games. In fact, a recent poll from the Mobile Video Industry Council found that anywhere between 25 to 50% of 5G data traffic will come from cloud gaming by 2022. Operators like Playgiga and Hatch are already forming partnerships with cloud-gaming providers like AT&T and Sprint. Overall, the growth in cloud gaming and 5G will only complement Microsoft’s shift from a device-centric strategy towards a player-centric one. ', '', '', 'Long Term Outlook', '', 'Consolidation Trends - Focus on Contents - Game Publisher / Streaming Targets', '', 'To be a successful player in the gaming industry, companies need to have global cloud infrastructure, hardware capabilities (whether that be client consoles/PCs or data centres) and library of streamable games. There has been a trend of consolidation within the gaming industry particularly when considering cloud gaming and creative studios. Microsoft itself has a long history of acquiring creative studios to create content to suit their hardware whether that be Xbox One or Windows 10 PC gaming. For instance, Microsoft acquired Lionhead Studios to develop Fable Legends to suit their desires. Firstly, Lionhead optimised the game for Xbox One, then for DirectX12 graphics for Windows 10 PC gamers and then Xbox One and Windows 10 Crossplay capabilities. Larger companies want to differentiate themselves with their game offerings by utilizing the creative talents of indie and smaller game developers (to attract prospective gamers) while also ensuring the content is compatible and promotes their own existing software and hardware. Hardware is another area where it is very plausible to see consolidation.

Like Google, Amazon has the largest gaming streaming channel, Twitch and the largest cloud service provider, Amazon Web Services (AWS). However, Amazon’s largest competitive advantage is its prime customer base, the roll-out strategy for Amazon will primarily include bundles with its existing offerings in other fields and as Amazon develops more hardware capabilities, it will eventually compete on the same level as Sony, Microsoft and Google.', '', 'Apple Competitive Advantage: iOS Ecosystem & Hardware', '', 'Apple Arcade is one of many of Apple’s strategic initiatives to move away from its reliance on hardware sales because of the stagnation of iPhone/iPad sales growth. Unlike other competitors, Apple Arcade does not require users to purchase individual games after they subscribed, which is like Netflix’s “one price for all” business model. However, Apple has a limited number of games and tends to not include console games. With a 46% smartphone market share in the United States and 13.5% globally, Apple’s addressable market is limited to Apple users, therefore the network effect may not be as profound as other competitors.', '', 'Potential Entry - Facebook ', '', 'Facebook Gaming has launched in 2017, it serves Discord and Twitch as a streaming platform for gamers to stream their plays on PC. However, outside of streaming itself, Facebook has dedicated a lot of effort into Oculus’ Virtual Reality (VR) gaming development.

If completed, the deal would be one of the biggest transactions of 2020. The selling firm SoftBank, which acquired Arm for $31.4B in 2015, will receive $21.5B in Nvidia stock and $12B in cash. $2B of the cash portion of the deal will be paid as soon as the signing is completed. There are also specific financial targets included in the proposed deal which could see SoftBank earn up to $5B in performance related payments. As part of the agreement, $1.5B of Nvidia stock will also be issued to Arm employees; Arm’s employees were a valuable asset contributing to the deal’s massive $40B price tag. ', '', 'Through the acquisition, Nvidia will be able to laterally diversify its revenue sources beyond its core competencies. While both firms operate within the same wider semiconductors industry, their product offerings differ greatly. Nvidia focuses largely on the production and sale of graphics processing cards (GPUs), widely used in gaming computers and for data centers. In fact, 87% of their revenues alone in 2019 were generated from GPU sales. On the other hand, Arm’s business model is the licensing of their intellectual property, largely for microprocessor and CPU technology. Over 25% of all electronic devices and 95% of mobile phones use technology licensed by Arm. ', '', 'From the seller SoftBank’s perspective, the company highlighted that they believed Arm would create more shareholder value combined with Nvidia. As the deal is financed in majority by Nvidia stock and includes performance-related payment hurdles, Softbank retains an aligned interest in the long-term success of both Arm and Nvidia. Moreover, SoftBank has experienced a number of high-profile failures and controversies that have resulted in increased investor scrutiny, such as the highly scrutinized Nasdaq options “whale trades”. When SoftBank acquired Arm in 2016 for $32B, its share price fell over 7%. In reaction to news of the sale, SoftBank’s share price rose almost 10%. ', '', 'Through the sale of Arm to Nvidia, in which SoftBank will receive Nvidia stock, SoftBank has managed to sell the company in a deal worth $8B more than their initial purchase price. What is particularly interesting about the deal is that SoftBank has effectively retained an interest in Arm Holdings, while enhancing their liquidity. As Nvidia stock is a massive component of how the deal is financed, SoftBank will become a major shareholder in Nvidia and will have improved future liquidity for a later exit opportunity through public markets. On top of Arm’s growth, SoftBank also gains access to Nvidia’s growing chip manufacturing business. To show the historical growth that Nvidia has experienced, their share price performance since the date of SoftBank’s initial acquisition of Arm is illustrated below in Figure 1.

Indeed, billions of chips are sold each year thanks to the substantial number of smartphone devices that adopt Arm-based microcontrollers. Thus, with this acquisition Nvidia has entered the smartphone business through the front door, taking advantage of the steady growth that Arm has already experienced in this market. The deal has tremendous benefits for Arm’s ecosystem, enhancing Arm’s R&D capacity and expanding its IP portfolio with NVIDIA’s world-leading GPU and AI technology. Arm partners will also benefit from both companies’ offerings, including NVIDIA’s numerous innovations. ', '', ""The two companies will continue to be autonomous, with Arm remaining headquartered in Cambridge. Nvidia plans to expand on this site to build a world-class AI research facility, supporting developments in healthcare, life sciences, robotics, self-driving cars, and other fields. In order to attract researchers and scientists from all over the world to develop new groundbreaking projects, NVIDIA will build a state-of-the-art AI supercomputer, powered by Arm CPUs, together with training facilities for developers and a startup incubator. Arm Cambridge will be a world-class technology center. Arm will continue to operate with the current open licensing model which the buyer will use to scale up its artificial intelligence technology and to stimulate growth in new markets such as robotics, automotive, and high-performance computing. Arm's CEO will continue to be Simon Segars."", ""\nThe market reacted positively to the announcement of the deal, driving Nvidia's share price up as much as 8% and adding more than $25B to its equity value, which corresponds to about two-thirds of the equity needed to make the acquisition. Moreover, SoftBank shares value grew about 9% on news of the deal and renewed talks for the company going private.\n"", 'Long Term Outlook ', '', 'Nvidia’s acquisition of Arm has the potential to upend the entire mobile technology and chip designing industry. Under Nvidia’s current business, the company focuses on its leading AI computing platform and ability to create datacenters and high-performance platforms. However, the company has been unable to move into the space of creating their own central processing unit (CPU) chip, which is used across all electronic computing devices, and has forced customers to look elsewhere to fill this need. Instead, Nvidia has used its abilities to create graphic enhancing chips such as its successful GeForce RTX series. ', '', 'Although with Arm now under Nvidia’s wing, the company has the potential to finally fill this gap since Arm has been expanding its presence to include the creation of chip designs and technologies that are used in central processors. While Arm’s chips alone haven’t been able to compete with those produced by industry leaders such as Intel or AMD, the combination of Arm’s chip-making ability and network with Nvidia’s experience in graphic enhancers and AI platforms could revolutionize the industry by giving Nvidia control of all necessary components.

Intel currently leads the global market share in both CPUs and GPUs. If implemented successfully, the combined capabilities of Nvidia and Arm together could lead to the more commonplace adoption of Nvidia chips in portable electronic devices and reduce the market shares of Intel and AMD in the CPU sector, making Nvidia a global rival with Intel. However, given that the two companies currently do not have many overlapping products, such potential synergy creation likely would not be seen for quite some time. Nonetheless, Nvidia’s control over Arm would allow the company to directly shape its future direction to align with its own.', '', '', 'Barriers to closure/Risks & Uncertainties', 'Barriers to closure/Risks & Uncertainties', '', 'With this acquisition of Arm being the largest to date in the mobile chip sector, the $40B deal is subject to close scrutiny.

Arm has licensing connections with the majority of companies that make mobile-device processors and other variations of chips, and many of these same companies are direct competitors with Nvidia or have the potential to be in the future. ', '', 'The regulatory approval process was fast in 2016 when SoftBank acquired Arm since the Japanese conglomerate was not directly competing with any of Arm’s clients. Even though Nvidia no longer develops smartphone chips, they are the world leader in graphic processing chips. Acquiring Arm gives them the potential to access the British company’s shipment volume and pricing information, so it wouldn’t be surprising if after the acquisition the company soon begins to develop products that would compete with Arm’s customer’s products. ', '', 'Another barrier to the global approval process is the escalating hostile relationship between the U.S. and China. Semiconductors have been caught in the middle of the trade and technology war between the two countries as the industry represents tech supremacy. The Nvidia-Arm deal is projected to have a very lengthy approval process; even Nvidia’s acquisition of Mellanox took over a year given its uncontroversial nature. ', '', 'Arm’s chips are the main structure for high-level electronics controlled by Big Tech and militaries, and the company coming into American control could create complications as the tech war heats up, especially as Beijing plans to halt foreign supply shipments. Long-term we could be witnessing more and more Chinese companies dissociate from Arm’s products to prevent their sensitive client data from being in the hands of the U.S. and to eliminate the fear of their supply being potentially cut-off one day. Nvidia reportedly does not expect exports to be an issue as Arm would continue to be headquartered in the U.K. ', '', 'Other than regulatory approval uncertainties, Hauser has been an outspoken opponent of the deal over fears that Nvidia would not keep their sizable workforce and R&D focused in their headquarters under the acquisition despite their promises. Currently, more than 3,000 employees are based in Britain but there are worries that the workforce will decrease in the future. Hauser expressed similar concerns over the SoftBank acquisition in 2016, but admits the company kept its promises to keep Cambridge as the main site of Arm’s research. Nvidia has stressed that they will keep the headquarters in Cambridge and invest in a new AI research center there. ', '', 'This $40B acquisition is not without several barriers to complete the deal and the risks posed to other firms are difficult to determine. While there is no conflict of interest as of now, the nature to which there will be in the future is unpredictable, but most definitely possible to be high. Nvidia will have to find the right balance between their own innovation and the work of Arm. Arm will ultimately need to be granted a level of independence to avoid government interjection and a loss of major clients to truly make their sizable investment worthwhile.

Although the deal is classified as a merger, it is essentially a takeover of Bankia by CaixaBank – they are 3x greater in market value and 2x as large in assets. As a result, other Spanish banks are growing keen on buying or joining rival banks to explore strategic options and be in a stronger position for cross-border deals. The merger also allows for CaixaBank to make significant annual cost cuts, resulting in increased revenue of about 1.1 billion (EUR). Together, the consolidated Spanish bank is expected to generate approximately 770 million (EUR) in cost synergies and within the next five years and is projected to reach an estimated annual revenue of 290 million (EUR).', ' ', 'The short-term consequences of the CaixaBank takeover are significant; there are a considerable number of job shutdowns and closing branches that come with the synergy. The main trade union Workers’ Commission (CCOO) has estimated over 51,000 staff to lose employment and approximately 6,300 branches to close in Spain. ', ' ', 'On the other hand, with the profitability of Spanish banks at risk due to low interest rates, subdued credit demand, and increased regulatory costs, the merger has allowed for CaixaBank to dramatically reduce overcapacity and increase profits. CaixaBank, with connections deep throughout a thriving Catalonia, will be able to broaden their presence into the nation’s large consumer and economic structure. In doing so, the Spanish banks will be able to cut off punitive competition and recover from their slowly diminishing profitability.', ' ', '“With this operation, we will form the principal Spanish franchise at a moment when it’s more necessary than ever to create entities with a critical size,” ', 'Goirigolzarri (Current President of Bankia)', '', '', 'Long-term consequences', '', 'This acquisition projects to be the beginning of what has been denominated “a new era in the Spanish banking sector”, as the Spanish banking industry looks to quickly consolidate in order to mitigate the adverse effects of the coronavirus pandemic. This, in fact, has been the decisive factor behind this merger, which was once before proposed in 2012 albeit with an unsuccessful outcome (the situation for the banks then was not as dire as the current one, with analysts describing the rationale behind this deal as a “question of survival”).', '', 'Amongst an agonizing Spanish economy, other banks will be looking to swiftly follow CaixaBank and Bankia’s footsteps. Rumours include Santander acquiring Bankinter or a BBVA merger with Banco Sabadell, as these entities hope to remain on top of their competition (before the merger, BBVA and Santander ranked first and second respectively amongst Spanish financial institutions, with both now trailing the post-merger CaixaBank in terms of assets and market share). Altogether these banks already comprise 72.4% of all financial assets held nationally, with these figures only looking to increase as the industry consolidates further.', '', 'Experts in fact consider larger national banks acquiring smaller entities to be but the onset of an increasing trend, and one that could expand well beyond international frontiers; with Spanish banks merging with those from other European nations such as Italy (where the sector is highly fragmented), France or Germany (where banks are facing similar profitability issues). Many believe this will lead to a wave of mergers that will leave behind a highly concentrated future banking sector; namely a “handful of big players”.

Both institutions’ boards have approved of this deal, which is now only waiting to be sanctioned by the “Ministerio de Asuntos Económicos” and “Comisión Nacional de Los Mercados y la Competencia”. The presence of left-wing populist party “Podemos” in the governing coalition has given rise to rumours that they could resist the deal, but no real opposition is expected as the case for an oligopoly between CaixaBank and the other 4 big Spanish banks has already been debunked (the flow and rates of credit are not projected to be altered as a result of this or any future mergers, and they are in fact expected to become more competitive).', '', 'Instead, the main issue facing this merger at this stage (albeit not significant) will be the backlash at the prospective loss of employment; 30%-40% of Bankia’s offices expect to be closed, and 5,000-15,000 jobs are to be cut as a result of redundancies. The headquarters, however, will remain unchanged as both banks are based in the city of Valencia; CaixaBank moved its offices from Barcelona to Valencia following the civil unrest that gripped the city in 2017, as the massive protests for independence after an illegal referendum turned violent. Nonetheless, CaixaBank still retains significant influence in the Catalonia region; this alone should make the new entity into a Spanish banking powerhouse, ready to “rub shoulders with the largest European financial institutions”.', '', 'Another hot topic of debate around this merger has been how the Spanish government itself stands to benefit from this deal. This is because in 2012 the Spanish government bailed out Bankia as part of a €40 billion rescue package for the Spanish financial industry. This left them with a 60% stake in Bankia, (since then increased to 61.8%), a bank that had missed 3 straight deadlines (and by all means looking to miss a 4th one this January 2021) to take the company private and return the taxpayers’ money. Although in all likelihood this recouping of taxpayers’ funds still won’t take place after the merger, Luis de Guindos (ECB vice-president) has repeatedly defended bailing out Bankia, warning the “alternative would have been significantly more costly” and expressing hope that the merger might improve the situation. Moreover, after the merger, the State will see its stake diluted to a much more digestible 15% of a bank that looks to be more profitable than the weakened stand-alone Bankia. Consequently, the ECB and Banco de España have collectively voiced their approval of this deal, as the ECB actively encourages further consolidation of the European banking industry.

Investors are mainly worried about the hefty price tag of $27.7B for Slack, which represents a 54% premium to its unaffected price or 26x forward sales. Having made as many as 60 acquisitions over the years, six of which occurred in 2019, investors are wary of Salesforce’s over-reliance on acquisition for growth. This is coupled with the fact that Slack has been underperforming its cloud peers during this work-from-home shift. For instance, Zoom’s Q3 revenue grew 365% while Slack’s grew a mere 39%. Video chat in Slack remains more basic than what rival Zoom has offered, limited to calls within an organization instead of letting a wider network of users jump on a virtual meeting.', '', '', 'Long-term outlook', '', 'Due to the lockdowns resulting from COVID-19, companies were forced to rapidly adapt overnight to be able to communicate remotely across all levels of a firm.

Using unified communication software, such as Slack and Microsoft Teams, firms adapted and found convenient ways to stay connected and on top of their business operations even when distantly separated. Aspects of remote work are likely to persist to a certain degree post-pandemic due to the convenience of messaging tools, as a survey conducted by RBC Capital Markets has shown that more than 40% of workers found workplace messaging tools as “absolutely critical” after COVID-19. Therefore, Salesforce’s long-term offering as an all-encompassing CRM provider will be significantly strengthened by their acquisition of Slack.

In turn, Slack’s acquisition will not only generate long-run revenue synergies for the company but also help Salesforce better compete with its major rival Microsoft."", '', 'Another benefit that the consolidation brings is that Slack can help Salesforce bring traction to other CRM products. Previously, Microsoft has used its Teams software to cross-promote other Office 365 products. Similarly, Salesforce can integrate Slack with its other softwares to create a more complete productivity suite for its users. This way, the company can cross-sell or upsell its existing cloud service products, which contributes to the company’s consistent goal of 25% year-on-year growth in revenue.

With the acquisitions of Slack in 2020, Tableau in 2019, and MuleSoft in 2018, Salesforce’s CEO Marc Benioff is attempting to transform the company into a “one-stop shop” for all business operations related to sales and marketing. Ultimately, buying Slack may prompt Salesforce to acquire other online collaborative products to complement Slack, such as Dropbox for better document management and RingCentral for better video conferencing. Moreover, the trend of acquisition in the industry will continue as other SaaS companies like SAP and Oracle may be urged to conduct more M&As so they can better compete and keep up with the trend in the industry.', ' ', '', 'Figure 6: Salesforce’s Major Acquisition Timeline (2016-2020)', '', 'Risks and Uncertainties', '', ""As far as internal uncertainties go, the board of directors of both companies have approved the transaction with the Slack board recommending that Slack stakeholders approve the transaction and adopt the merger agreement. However, UBS analysts argue that with Salesforce's massive value and size that development to Slack’s software would not be given proper attention, noting that they are “less and less clear about the direction that Salesforce is heading”. With the short term of the acquisition geared towards linking Slack into the Salesforce portfolio, some things that customers are looking forward to in the near future may not come to fruition, which could severely impact Slack’s performance. "", '', 'On the other hand, Slack could be a distraction for Salesforce management and could therefore not be believed to be the best owner for Slack. A much better suited one could argue could be Google or Amazon as they could integrate Slack into their platforms, but that would be unlikely due to antitrust regulations. Furthermore, Slack’s growth should be a risk for Salesforce. They have not turned a profit since their initial public offering last year. Since Slack is a SaaS valued at multiples of revenue instead of profits, their growth forecast faces immense pressure on its ability to materialize as earnings. This is concerning for Salesforce, who would be giving up nearly 13% of their market value for the acquisition based on Slack’s EV/Sales multiple seen in Figure 2.  Further, if Salesforce were to affect Slack’s internal operations through the acquisition, some existing customers may be turned away, as many customers now enjoy Slack for their simplicity and neutrality. Given the risks of the deal and Salesforce’s valuation of over $200 billion, analysts have suggested that their investors root for an antitrust review to prevent the deal.', '', 'Naturally, any deal of this size is subject to antitrust speculation. An antitrust debate has arisen after Slack has said that they cannot compete without a “defensive acquisition” despite saying they wanted to stay independent. This brings about a larger issue regarding a power disparity revolving mostly around Big Tech. Nonetheless, Salesforce is expected to be successful in its acquisition of Slack. It remains to be seen whether Slack will stay an independent entity after the acquisition as Salesforce has rebranded both Demandware and ExactTarget as Salesforce Commerce Cloud and Marketing Cloud respectively, yet allowed Tableau, MuleSoft, and Quip to keep their branding.

Spotify did so through “localization,” i.e. by tailoring their offerings to local tastes and adjusting their pricing to local expectations. Network effects have abetted Spotify’s international expansion, as the value of Spotify’s platform grows with every additional user and artist.

It is no wonder Spotify has made such a push to dominate the market. Podcasting revenue is expected to hit $1.1 billion in 2021; this growth will benefit the many publishers and advertising companies that take advantage of the acquisition between Spotify and Megaphone and their new ad based systems.

For those Americans that regularly listen to podcasts, the average listening time was 6 hours, 39 minutes. Advertising has also seen many benefits from the increased consumption of podcasts. Roughly 54% of podcasts listeners stated they were more likely to buy something from a brand after hearing its advertisement on a podcast. ', '', ""The introduction of dynamically targeted ads to the podcast industry could be pivotal for companies looking to accelerate advertising revenue. Roughly 90% of Spotify's revenue comes from its subscription service, however, new advertising technology could serve as a catalyst not only for Spotify but other streaming services as well. Spotify has placed an emphasis on audio services rather than strictly music services, a trend which will be replicated by companies like Apple, Amazon, and Google.

It is important to understand that Spotify continues to grow at a steady rate and therefore it must look for ways to innovate its service. Bring new features or further developing the podcast platform can help them maintain their advantage over Apple Music.', ' ', ' It is also important to highlight that Spotify has not quite yet established itself as the dominant company within the podcast industry.

However, “U.S. weekly podcast downloads were up 20% for the week ending April 19 compared to the first week of January, Podtrac said” (Lee,2020).

Indeed, the goal is to develop an international business support and capital raising platform for ambitious and fast growing companies, called ""ELITE"". Moreover, while Borsa’s bond trading platform MTS will give Euronext its first foray into fixed income trading, the french single order book will offer the Milan based stock exchange a unique gateway to investors in accessing the largest liquidity pool in Europe.

Refinitiv is a data provider, 45% owned by the parent company of Reuters News, Thomas Reuters Corp. The reason for the divestment of Borsa was to ease the concerns the European Commission has over LSE controlling the European bond market; there has been significant regulatory scrutiny over the proposed deal with Refinitiv. In fact, the transaction's completion depends upon European authorities allowing for the Refinitiv acquisition to go through. LSE has said they would have preferred to keep their Italian arm, but are reassured from the sale given they will make a considerable profit; the 2007 purchase of Borsa was for €1.6B.

Therefore, the agreed amount is a reasonable price for LSE considering the Italian business' skew to cash trading and clearing."", '', ""For Euronext, the acquisition of Borsa marks a turning point in their history. By welcoming the third-largest economy in Europe, Euronext can diversify their revenue streams and geographical footprint. The sale has opened the doors for them to build the leading pan-European market infrastructure as well as creating the backbone of the European capital markets union, according to Euronext CEO Stephane Boujnah. This new opportunity will be streamlined from the integration of MTS, Borsa's bond trading platform, which will enable Euronext to enter into fixed income trading for the first time. Rather than from job cuts, the purchase's synergies will most likely be coming from adopting Borsa's MTS technology platform. While the deal is requiring €1.8B in debt and €2.4B  in new equity in funding, the acquisition gives the French operator 25% of all equity trading in Europe and a clearinghouse for the first time.

Stéphane Boujnah, chief executive of Euronext, called the deal “a turning point in our group’s history”, stating that the transaction “will create the backbone of the Capital Markets Union in Europe”. Euronext’s acquisition of Borsa Italiana makes Italy the largest contributor to the group, reflecting the deals’ long-term strategic importance.', '', 'Involving Borsa Italiana in its transnational consortium of stock exchanges allows Euronext to expand its operations with respect to its tremendous reach and impact on European capital markets. Its venues would be home to a quarter of Europe’s €30bn-a-day trading in equities, reflecting the extensive consolidation and reach of Euronext’s products and platforms. The contribution of Italy as a G7 economy allows the group to build on existing structures in Dublin, Oslo, Paris and other European countries, expanding its network to more potential customers and adding to its over 1,463 listed companies. This will allow the group to further connect markets and allow easy-to-access opportunities for investors. After gaining access to the Italian market, this long-term positioning will allow Euronext to concentrate on expanding its product and platform diversity, while continuously adding depth to operations in Italy.', '', 'The deal gives Borsa Italiana a clearinghouse for the first time as well as a securities depository, stock exchange and bond platform. As a result, Euronext’s Mr. Boujnah also expressed that revenue synergies from the deal would mainly be achieved by moving Borsa Italiana to Euronext’s technology platform rather than through job cuts. Access to this technology platform will allow Borsa Italiana to benefit from a greater variety of products and new clients through faster and more digital processes. These long term revenue synergies are extended by creating a network of integrated platforms of transnationally connected stock exchanges, accumulating European investors on their platform. By fostering Italy’s market diversity in bond and equity markets, as well as giving access to new technology, Euronext’s transferred capabilities will allow Borsa Italiana to achieve long term growth within the firm and generate efficiencies for investors.', '', ""Finally, the deal contains essential impacts on Italy’s political and economic landscape. In the long run, involved stakeholders are hoping for the deal to contribute to the Italian economy by giving investors easier access to markets but also through political ties established for the transaction. Borsa Italiana is seen as a strategic asset in Italy because of its ownership of MTS SpA, a platform used to trade government bonds. While this made the deal politically sensitive, Euronext executed the transaction by teaming up with state agency Cassa Depositi e Prestiti (CDP) and Italy's biggest bank Intesa SanPaolo. Cooperating with central Italian financial institutions will add to Euronext’s powerful position in European markets and increase flexibility in its operations due to direct access to decision makers in the country. "", '', '', 'Barriers to the closure of the deal', '', 'A strong motivating factor behind LSE’s sale of Borsa Italiana is the desire to meet the anti-competition concerns of the E.U. ahead of their planned $27B acquisition of Refinitiv. However, if there are significant changes to LSE’s commitment to the deal, the Borsa Italiana sale may be in jeopardy. Included in the terms of the agreement is a contingency on the Refinitiv deal going through. Therefore, if LSE attempts to withdraw from the Refinitiv deal by citing any of the exit clauses in that contract, the Borsa Italiana deal would likely not go through.', '', 'LSE may also be forced to not go through with the acquisition if the commitments that the LSE group makes to address anti-competition concerns are not enough to satisfy the E.U. regulator. For instance, LSE recently had to make commitments to keep its trading business separate from its interest rate derivatives clearing business. If LSE is unable or unwilling to make further commitments to meet the demands of the E.U. regulator and abandons the Refinitiv deal, they could swiftly turn around and look for the legal remedies they have included in the Borsa Italiana sale agreement to walk away from the transaction. ', '', 'Further, other remedies to meet E.U. regulators’ demands may also be successful. If measures less severe than the sale of Borsa Italiana suffice, LSE may look for options to walk away from the deal. Recent threats by LVMH to walk away in their agreed deal to purchase Tiffany’s illustrate the extent to which deals that have already been agreed to can still be amended. LSE could potentially use better circumstances in their negotiations with regulators to keep a hold of the valuable Borsa Italiana asset. ', '', 'As part of the agreement, both companies LSE and Euronext had to gain shareholder approval of the deal. Results at LSE’s general meeting overwhelmingly supported the deal; 291,694,564 votes for and only 4,193 submitted against.

', '', 'Cloud Gaming 3-Phase Transmission', '', 'The transition to cloud gaming is occurring in real-time and is part of the 2 phases of gaming; digitalisation of gaming and cloud gaming transmission. Both transitions can be explained by explaining the changes in the customer journey and the hardware.', '', 'Firstly, came physical to digital media. This is due to 2 main points. Firstly, the changes in the customer journey of selecting a game from buying a physical disc from a store to downloading a game from the relevant virtual store. Secondly, came the changes in hardware to make them either physical and digital or digital solely compatible, thus pushing legacy gamers away from solely relying on physical game media. This is shown in Figure 2, with the movement from the Xbox 360 to the Xbox One series, with the Xbox One S being digital only. Currently, gaming is transitioning into cloud gaming. The change in the customer journey goes hand in hand with the change in hardware requirements. Often, gamers could only play games limited by the capacity of their own console/PC. With cloud gaming, any hardware shortfalls are eliminated as one essentially plays the game by streaming the outputs onto their device whilst simultaneously streaming back the game inputs to a data centre server. ', '', 'What this now means is that gamers can choose any game of their choosing in the knowledge that they now have the capacity to do so. Now with software innovations such as Xbox Game Pass and Playstation Now, gamers can purchase games and then stream the gaming experience onto their device. This has resulted in massive changes for the fourth generation of Xbox. The digital only console, Xbox Series S, is significantly smaller than the dual media Xbox Series X due to reduced levels of hardware. The Xbox Series S is designed specifically for cloud gaming as hardware is no longer a consideration and the lower cost of the console starts to push gamers towards this new model of gaming', '', 'Continued Growth in Cloud Gaming', '', 'The growth in the global cloud gaming is an upside for this acquisition. By removing the requirement for hardware, cloud gaming allows users to play on smart devices with high-speech Internet. Cloud gaming also lifts barriers for cost-conscious consumers, thereby attracting casual gamers into the market. Grand View Research reports that the cloud gaming market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 47.9% from 2020 to 2027. North America is expected to see the strongest growth in that period due to higher R&D investment in cloud computing, more widespread adoption of smartphones, and the presence of high-speed Internet. Asia, too, will see a significant growth in the coming decade due to a massive untapped gaming population and the recent penetration of smartphones. ', '', 'The rise of 5G in developed countries like the US and South Korea is expected to contribute to this growth, as mobile gaming has been limited thus far to low-spec games. Consumer bandwidth has been an impediment for streaming services and game operators alike, so the recent spread of 5G will revolutionize connectivity at users’ homes and maximize the potential of cloud gaming. 5G’s higher speeds and lower latencies are truly a game changer for cloud gaming, as they will enable mobile devices to support more complex games and accelerate the transition away from casual low-spec games. In fact, a recent poll from the Mobile Video Industry Council found that anywhere between 25 to 50% of 5G data traffic will come from cloud gaming by 2022. Operators like Playgiga and Hatch are already forming partnerships with cloud-gaming providers like AT&T and Sprint. Overall, the growth in cloud gaming and 5G will only complement Microsoft’s shift from a device-centric strategy towards a player-centric one. ', '', '', 'Long Term Outlook', '', 'Consolidation Trends - Focus on Contents - Game Publisher / Streaming Targets', '', 'To be a successful player in the gaming industry, companies need to have global cloud infrastructure, hardware capabilities (whether that be client consoles/PCs or data centres) and library of streamable games. There has been a trend of consolidation within the gaming industry particularly when considering cloud gaming and creative studios. Microsoft itself has a long history of acquiring creative studios to create content to suit their hardware whether that be Xbox One or Windows 10 PC gaming. For instance, Microsoft acquired Lionhead Studios to develop Fable Legends to suit their desires. Firstly, Lionhead optimised the game for Xbox One, then for DirectX12 graphics for Windows 10 PC gamers and then Xbox One and Windows 10 Crossplay capabilities.

Unlike other competitors, Apple Arcade does not require users to purchase individual games after they subscribed, which is like Netflix’s “one price for all” business model. However, Apple has a limited number of games and tends to not include console games. With a 46% smartphone market share in the United States and 13.5% globally, Apple’s addressable market is limited to Apple users, therefore the network effect may not be as profound as other competitors.', '', 'Potential Entry - Facebook ', '', 'Facebook Gaming has launched in 2017, it serves Discord and Twitch as a streaming platform for gamers to stream their plays on PC. However, outside of streaming itself, Facebook has dedicated a lot of effort into Oculus’ Virtual Reality (VR) gaming development.

Arm has licensing connections with the majority of companies that make mobile-device processors and other variations of chips, and many of these same companies are direct competitors with Nvidia or have the potential to be in the future. ', '', 'The regulatory approval process was fast in 2016 when SoftBank acquired Arm since the Japanese conglomerate was not directly competing with any of Arm’s clients. Even though Nvidia no longer develops smartphone chips, they are the world leader in graphic processing chips. Acquiring Arm gives them the potential to access the British company’s shipment volume and pricing information, so it wouldn’t be surprising if after the acquisition the company soon begins to develop products that would compete with Arm’s customer’s products. ', '', 'Another barrier to the global approval process is the escalating hostile relationship between the U.S. and China. Semiconductors have been caught in the middle of the trade and technology war between the two countries as the industry represents tech supremacy. The Nvidia-Arm deal is projected to have a very lengthy approval process; even Nvidia’s acquisition of Mellanox took over a year given its uncontroversial nature. ', '', 'Arm’s chips are the main structure for high-level electronics controlled by Big Tech and militaries, and the company coming into American control could create complications as the tech war heats up, especially as Beijing plans to halt foreign supply shipments. Long-term we could be witnessing more and more Chinese companies dissociate from Arm’s products to prevent their sensitive client data from being in the hands of the U.S. and to eliminate the fear of their supply being potentially cut-off one day. Nvidia reportedly does not expect exports to be an issue as Arm would continue to be headquartered in the U.K. ', '', 'Other than regulatory approval uncertainties, Hauser has been an outspoken opponent of the deal over fears that Nvidia would not keep their sizable workforce and R&D focused in their headquarters under the acquisition despite their promises. Currently, more than 3,000 employees are based in Britain but there are worries that the workforce will decrease in the future. Hauser expressed similar concerns over the SoftBank acquisition in 2016, but admits the company kept its promises to keep Cambridge as the main site of Arm’s research. Nvidia has stressed that they will keep the headquarters in Cambridge and invest in a new AI research center there. ', '', 'This $40B acquisition is not without several barriers to complete the deal and the risks posed to other firms are difficult to determine. While there is no conflict of interest as of now, the nature to which there will be in the future is unpredictable, but most definitely possible to be high. Nvidia will have to find the right balance between their own innovation and the work of Arm. Arm will ultimately need to be granted a level of independence to avoid government interjection and a loss of major clients to truly make their sizable investment worthwhile.

Although the deal is classified as a merger, it is essentially a takeover of Bankia by CaixaBank – they are 3x greater in market value and 2x as large in assets. As a result, other Spanish banks are growing keen on buying or joining rival banks to explore strategic options and be in a stronger position for cross-border deals. The merger also allows for CaixaBank to make significant annual cost cuts, resulting in increased revenue of about 1.1 billion (EUR). Together, the consolidated Spanish bank is expected to generate approximately 770 million (EUR) in cost synergies and within the next five years and is projected to reach an estimated annual revenue of 290 million (EUR).', ' ', 'The short-term consequences of the CaixaBank takeover are significant; there are a considerable number of job shutdowns and closing branches that come with the synergy. The main trade union Workers’ Commission (CCOO) has estimated over 51,000 staff to lose employment and approximately 6,300 branches to close in Spain. ', ' ', 'On the other hand, with the profitability of Spanish banks at risk due to low interest rates, subdued credit demand, and increased regulatory costs, the merger has allowed for CaixaBank to dramatically reduce overcapacity and increase profits. CaixaBank, with connections deep throughout a thriving Catalonia, will be able to broaden their presence into the nation’s large consumer and economic structure. In doing so, the Spanish banks will be able to cut off punitive competition and recover from their slowly diminishing profitability.', ' ', '“With this operation, we will form the principal Spanish franchise at a moment when it’s more necessary than ever to create entities with a critical size,” ', 'Goirigolzarri (Current President of Bankia)', '', '', 'Long-term consequences', '', 'This acquisition projects to be the beginning of what has been denominated “a new era in the Spanish banking sector”, as the Spanish banking industry looks to quickly consolidate in order to mitigate the adverse effects of the coronavirus pandemic. This, in fact, has been the decisive factor behind this merger, which was once before proposed in 2012 albeit with an unsuccessful outcome (the situation for the banks then was not as dire as the current one, with analysts describing the rationale behind this deal as a “question of survival”).', '', 'Amongst an agonizing Spanish economy, other banks will be looking to swiftly follow CaixaBank and Bankia’s footsteps. Rumours include Santander acquiring Bankinter or a BBVA merger with Banco Sabadell, as these entities hope to remain on top of their competition (before the merger, BBVA and Santander ranked first and second respectively amongst Spanish financial institutions, with both now trailing the post-merger CaixaBank in terms of assets and market share). Altogether these banks already comprise 72.4% of all financial assets held nationally, with these figures only looking to increase as the industry consolidates further.', '', 'Experts in fact consider larger national banks acquiring smaller entities to be but the onset of an increasing trend, and one that could expand well beyond international frontiers; with Spanish banks merging with those from other European nations such as Italy (where the sector is highly fragmented), France or Germany (where banks are facing similar profitability issues). Many believe this will lead to a wave of mergers that will leave behind a highly concentrated future banking sector; namely a “handful of big players”. These larger institutions would be better equipped to deal with the pressures of increasing delinquency, negative interest rates or the threats posed by fintech.', '', '', 'Risks and uncertainties', '', 'Barring any unforeseen issues, the merger should go ahead as planned and be completed by Q1 2021. Both institutions’ boards have approved of this deal, which is now only waiting to be sanctioned by the “Ministerio de Asuntos Económicos” and “Comisión Nacional de Los Mercados y la Competencia”. The presence of left-wing populist party “Podemos” in the governing coalition has given rise to rumours that they could resist the deal, but no real opposition is expected as the case for an oligopoly between CaixaBank and the other 4 big Spanish banks has already been debunked (the flow and rates of credit are not projected to be altered as a result of this or any future mergers, and they are in fact expected to become more competitive).', '', 'Instead, the main issue facing this merger at this stage (albeit not significant) will be the backlash at the prospective loss of employment; 30%-40% of Bankia’s offices expect to be closed, and 5,000-15,000 jobs are to be cut as a result of redundancies. The headquarters, however, will remain unchanged as both banks are based in the city of Valencia; CaixaBank moved its offices from Barcelona to Valencia following the civil unrest that gripped the city in 2017, as the massive protests for independence after an illegal referendum turned violent. Nonetheless, CaixaBank still retains significant influence in the Catalonia region; this alone should make the new entity into a Spanish banking powerhouse, ready to “rub shoulders with the largest European financial institutions”.', '', 'Another hot topic of debate around this merger has been how the Spanish government itself stands to benefit from this deal. This is because in 2012 the Spanish government bailed out Bankia as part of a €40 billion rescue package for the Spanish financial industry. This left them with a 60% stake in Bankia, (since then increased to 61.8%), a bank that had missed 3 straight deadlines (and by all means looking to miss a 4th one this January 2021) to take the company private and return the taxpayers’ money. Although in all likelihood this recouping of taxpayers’ funds still won’t take place after the merger, Luis de Guindos (ECB vice-president) has repeatedly defended bailing out Bankia, warning the “alternative would have been significantly more costly” and expressing hope that the merger might improve the situation. Moreover, after the merger, the State will see its stake diluted to a much more digestible 15% of a bank that looks to be more profitable than the weakened stand-alone Bankia. Consequently, the ECB and Banco de España have collectively voiced their approval of this deal, as the ECB actively encourages further consolidation of the European banking industry. This process is expected to take place “by stages”, with this merger seemingly being the first one.', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Oct 23, 2020', '6 min read', 'Sunrun acquires Vivint in all stock transaction valued at  $3.2 billion ', 'Sunrun acquires Vivint in all stock transaction valued at  $3.2 billion ', 'By Vadim Mandel (London School of Economics) ', 'By Vadim Mandel (London School of Economics) ', '', '', 'Overview of the Deal\xa0', 'Overview of the Deal\xa0', '', 'Sunrun (NYSE: RUN), America’s biggest rooftop- solar company has announced that it will be taking over rival Vivint Solar (VSLR) for $3.2bn in an all-stock transaction in one of the biggest deals in industry history expected to close in the 4th\xa0 quarter, pursuant to which each share of Vivint Solar common stock will be exchanged for 0.55 shares of Sunrun common stock, representing a combined\xa0 Enterprise Value of $9.2 billion.\xa0', 'Sunrun (NYSE: RUN), America’s biggest rooftop- solar company has announced', 'that it will be taking over rival Vivint Solar (VSLR) for $3.2bn in an ', 'transaction in one of the biggest deals in industry history expected to close in the 4th\xa0 quarter, pursuant to which each share of Vivint Solar common stock will be', 'exchanged for 0.55 shares of Sunrun common stock, representing a combined\xa0 Enterprise Value of $9.2 billion.\xa0', '', 'Vivint Solar stockholders are expected to own approximately 36% and Sunrun stockholders are expected to own approximately 64% of the fully diluted shares of the combined company.

Having made as many as 60 acquisitions over the years, six of which occurred in 2019, investors are wary of Salesforce’s over-reliance on acquisition for growth. This is coupled with the fact that Slack has been underperforming its cloud peers during this work-from-home shift. For instance, Zoom’s Q3 revenue grew 365% while Slack’s grew a mere 39%. Video chat in Slack remains more basic than what rival Zoom has offered, limited to calls within an organization instead of letting a wider network of users jump on a virtual meeting.', '', '', 'Long-term outlook', '', 'Due to the lockdowns resulting from COVID-19, companies were forced to rapidly adapt overnight to be able to communicate remotely across all levels of a firm.

Using unified communication software, such as Slack and Microsoft Teams, firms adapted and found convenient ways to stay connected and on top of their business operations even when distantly separated. Aspects of remote work are likely to persist to a certain degree post-pandemic due to the convenience of messaging tools, as a survey conducted by RBC Capital Markets has shown that more than 40% of workers found workplace messaging tools as “absolutely critical” after COVID-19.

In turn, Slack’s acquisition will not only generate long-run revenue synergies for the company but also help Salesforce better compete with its major rival Microsoft."", '', 'Another benefit that the consolidation brings is that Slack can help Salesforce bring traction to other CRM products. Previously, Microsoft has used its Teams software to cross-promote other Office 365 products. Similarly, Salesforce can integrate Slack with its other softwares to create a more complete productivity suite for its users. This way, the company can cross-sell or upsell its existing cloud service products, which contributes to the company’s consistent goal of 25% year-on-year growth in revenue.

With the acquisitions of Slack in 2020, Tableau in 2019, and MuleSoft in 2018, Salesforce’s CEO Marc Benioff is attempting to transform the company into a “one-stop shop” for all business operations related to sales and marketing. Ultimately, buying Slack may prompt Salesforce to acquire other online collaborative products to complement Slack, such as Dropbox for better document management and RingCentral for better video conferencing. Moreover, the trend of acquisition in the industry will continue as other SaaS companies like SAP and Oracle may be urged to conduct more M&As so they can better compete and keep up with the trend in the industry.', ' ', '', 'Figure 6: Salesforce’s Major Acquisition Timeline (2016-2020)', '', 'Risks and Uncertainties', '', ""As far as internal uncertainties go, the board of directors of both companies have approved the transaction with the Slack board recommending that Slack stakeholders approve the transaction and adopt the merger agreement. However, UBS analysts argue that with Salesforce's massive value and size that development to Slack’s software would not be given proper attention, noting that they are “less and less clear about the direction that Salesforce is heading”. With the short term of the acquisition geared towards linking Slack into the Salesforce portfolio, some things that customers are looking forward to in the near future may not come to fruition, which could severely impact Slack’s performance. "", '', 'On the other hand, Slack could be a distraction for Salesforce management and could therefore not be believed to be the best owner for Slack. A much better suited one could argue could be Google or Amazon as they could integrate Slack into their platforms, but that would be unlikely due to antitrust regulations. Furthermore, Slack’s growth should be a risk for Salesforce. They have not turned a profit since their initial public offering last year. Since Slack is a SaaS valued at multiples of revenue instead of profits, their growth forecast faces immense pressure on its ability to materialize as earnings. This is concerning for Salesforce, who would be giving up nearly 13% of their market value for the acquisition based on Slack’s EV/Sales multiple seen in Figure 2.  Further, if Salesforce were to affect Slack’s internal operations through the acquisition, some existing customers may be turned away, as many customers now enjoy Slack for their simplicity and neutrality. Given the risks of the deal and Salesforce’s valuation of over $200 billion, analysts have suggested that their investors root for an antitrust review to prevent the deal.', '', 'Naturally, any deal of this size is subject to antitrust speculation. An antitrust debate has arisen after Slack has said that they cannot compete without a “defensive acquisition” despite saying they wanted to stay independent. This brings about a larger issue regarding a power disparity revolving mostly around Big Tech. Nonetheless, Salesforce is expected to be successful in its acquisition of Slack. It remains to be seen whether Slack will stay an independent entity after the acquisition as Salesforce has rebranded both Demandware and ExactTarget as Salesforce Commerce Cloud and Marketing Cloud respectively, yet allowed Tableau, MuleSoft, and Quip to keep their branding.

In 2019, Spotify decided to double down in the podcast industry, with the acquisitions of Parcast and Anchor FM, to expand Spotify’s library of podcast offerings.', '', 'In 2020 February, Spotify acquired The Ringer, a sports & pop culture podcast network, to continue expanding its product offerings and make these podcasts only available on Spotify.

', '', '', 'Long Term Outlook - COVID Implications', '', 'As the Covid-19 pandemic continues, it is important to highlight the effects the lockdowns have had on podcast consumption. A great portion of the world population stayed home and did not commute to work. Initially, commuting was identified as the primary time frame for podcast listening and therefore, in its absence, experts believe the demand for podcasts would decrease. However, “U.S. weekly podcast downloads were up 20% for the week ending April 19 compared to the first week of January, Podtrac said” (Lee,2020). This can be attributed to the fact that individuals who stayed home had a surplus of time which they devoted listening to their favourite podcasts.', '', 'If we take a look at podcast producers, rather than listeners, it is also interesting to underline that Spotify is facilitating the production of podcasts so it can be a simple process carried out at home. In fact, “because podcasts can be produced remotely without crews, the pandemic has not disrupted Spotify’s slate of shows” (Lee, 2020).

Thus, it will be better positioned to deliver the ambition to further build the backbone of the Capital Markets Union in Europe. The combined group will operate exchanges with more than 1,800 listed companies and an aggregate market value of around €4.4 trillion. Moreover, it will be the main venue for secondary markets in Europe, with €11.7 billion worth of equities traded on a daily basis.

The comparable companies represent similar European exchange operators and similar business models. When also taking into consideration the control premium that Euronext has to pay in the deal, the price paid from this perspective seems very reasonable. However, when looking at only the EV/EBITDA multiple of competitors, Borsa Italiana’s estimated enterprise value is a far lower €3.6 billion, which would make the deal at a premium to its enterprise value. ', '', 'By combining their strong listing franchises, the two exchanges will facilitate access to equity financing for companies, strongly focusing on small and medium-sized enterprises (“SMEs”), family-owned and tech companies. Indeed, the goal is to develop an international business support and capital raising platform for ambitious and fast growing companies, called ""ELITE"". Moreover, while Borsa’s bond trading platform MTS will give Euronext its first foray into fixed income trading, the french single order book will offer the Milan based stock exchange a unique gateway to investors in accessing the largest liquidity pool in Europe. Moreover, the addition of Monte Titoli will more than double the size of Euronext’s CSD franchise, increasing assets under custody from €2.2 trillion to €5.6 trillion.', '', ""The deal is expected to enhance both companies' businesses across all their segments. This complementarity is expected to lead to greater benefits for investors, issuers and shareholders, creating a more comprehensive offering under a resilient business based on a strong core of services.

Moreover, it is expected to deliver double digit accretion including run-rate synergies in year 3. The € 4.325 million will be paid in cash to LSEG at closing. The financing is fully secured through a bridge loan facility, underwritten by a group of banks. It includes €300 million of use of existing cash, €1.8 billion of new debt as well as € 2.4 billion of new equity to be issued.

Refinitiv is a data provider, 45% owned by the parent company of Reuters News, Thomas Reuters Corp. The reason for the divestment of Borsa was to ease the concerns the European Commission has over LSE controlling the European bond market; there has been significant regulatory scrutiny over the proposed deal with Refinitiv. In fact, the transaction's completion depends upon European authorities allowing for the Refinitiv acquisition to go through. LSE has said they would have preferred to keep their Italian arm, but are reassured from the sale given they will make a considerable profit; the 2007 purchase of Borsa was for €1.6B. "", '', ' ""We believe the sale of the Borsa Italiana group will contribute significantly to addressing the EU\'s competition concerns.” ', ""said David Schwimmer, LSE's chief executive officer. "", '', ""The valuation— 16.7x EV/adjusted 2019 EBITDA — is around the average for global exchanges. Therefore, the agreed amount is a reasonable price for LSE considering the Italian business' skew to cash trading and clearing."", '', ""For Euronext, the acquisition of Borsa marks a turning point in their history. By welcoming the third-largest economy in Europe, Euronext can diversify their revenue streams and geographical footprint. The sale has opened the doors for them to build the leading pan-European market infrastructure as well as creating the backbone of the European capital markets union, according to Euronext CEO Stephane Boujnah. This new opportunity will be streamlined from the integration of MTS, Borsa's bond trading platform, which will enable Euronext to enter into fixed income trading for the first time. Rather than from job cuts, the purchase's synergies will most likely be coming from adopting Borsa's MTS technology platform. While the deal is requiring €1.8B in debt and €2.4B  in new equity in funding, the acquisition gives the French operator 25% of all equity trading in Europe and a clearinghouse for the first time. Euronext will also see an improvement in their equity operations, the joint group operating with more than 1,800 listed companies—an accumulated market value of around  €4.4T."", '', 'On the day the deal had been announced, October 9, shares in LSE rose 0.2% in early trading. The group’s shareholders are confident about their decision to sell Borsa since the deal will bring Refinitiv’s acquisition one step closer. On the same day, shares closed 0.4%. Euronext saw a 0.6% rise in their shares in early trading on the news of the deal as shareholders unanimously backed the deal. However, Euronext’s stock saw a decline of 4.4% at closing, which could suggest dissatisfaction by investors for Borsa.', '', 'Figure 3. Euronext Price Development (SeekingAlpha)', '', 'With high market volatility caused by rising COVID-19 cases across Europe and stricter lockdown measures, there have been sporadic decreases on the European markets (see Figure 3). On October 28 shares in both LSE and Euronext closed down by 6.2 and 9.9%, likely as a result.', '', '', 'Long-term outlook', '', 'Adding Borsa Italiana to its collection of European stock exchanges, Euronext expands its position as one of the most important owners of market infrastructure in Europe. Stéphane Boujnah, chief executive of Euronext, called the deal “a turning point in our group’s history”, stating that the transaction “will create the backbone of the Capital Markets Union in Europe”. Euronext’s acquisition of Borsa Italiana makes Italy the largest contributor to the group, reflecting the deals’ long-term strategic importance.', '', 'Involving Borsa Italiana in its transnational consortium of stock exchanges allows Euronext to expand its operations with respect to its tremendous reach and impact on European capital markets. Its venues would be home to a quarter of Europe’s €30bn-a-day trading in equities, reflecting the extensive consolidation and reach of Euronext’s products and platforms. The contribution of Italy as a G7 economy allows the group to build on existing structures in Dublin, Oslo, Paris and other European countries, expanding its network to more potential customers and adding to its over 1,463 listed companies. This will allow the group to further connect markets and allow easy-to-access opportunities for investors. After gaining access to the Italian market, this long-term positioning will allow Euronext to concentrate on expanding its product and platform diversity, while continuously adding depth to operations in Italy.', '', 'The deal gives Borsa Italiana a clearinghouse for the first time as well as a securities depository, stock exchange and bond platform. As a result, Euronext’s Mr. Boujnah also expressed that revenue synergies from the deal would mainly be achieved by moving Borsa Italiana to Euronext’s technology platform rather than through job cuts. Access to this technology platform will allow Borsa Italiana to benefit from a greater variety of products and new clients through faster and more digital processes. These long term revenue synergies are extended by creating a network of integrated platforms of transnationally connected stock exchanges, accumulating European investors on their platform. By fostering Italy’s market diversity in bond and equity markets, as well as giving access to new technology, Euronext’s transferred capabilities will allow Borsa Italiana to achieve long term growth within the firm and generate efficiencies for investors.', '', ""Finally, the deal contains essential impacts on Italy’s political and economic landscape. In the long run, involved stakeholders are hoping for the deal to contribute to the Italian economy by giving investors easier access to markets but also through political ties established for the transaction. Borsa Italiana is seen as a strategic asset in Italy because of its ownership of MTS SpA, a platform used to trade government bonds. While this made the deal politically sensitive, Euronext executed the transaction by teaming up with state agency Cassa Depositi e Prestiti (CDP) and Italy's biggest bank Intesa SanPaolo. Cooperating with central Italian financial institutions will add to Euronext’s powerful position in European markets and increase flexibility in its operations due to direct access to decision makers in the country. "", '', '', 'Barriers to the closure of the deal', '', 'A strong motivating factor behind LSE’s sale of Borsa Italiana is the desire to meet the anti-competition concerns of the E.U. ahead of their planned $27B acquisition of Refinitiv. However, if there are significant changes to LSE’s commitment to the deal, the Borsa Italiana sale may be in jeopardy. Included in the terms of the agreement is a contingency on the Refinitiv deal going through. Therefore, if LSE attempts to withdraw from the Refinitiv deal by citing any of the exit clauses in that contract, the Borsa Italiana deal would likely not go through.', '', 'LSE may also be forced to not go through with the acquisition if the commitments that the LSE group makes to address anti-competition concerns are not enough to satisfy the E.U. regulator. For instance, LSE recently had to make commitments to keep its trading business separate from its interest rate derivatives clearing business. If LSE is unable or unwilling to make further commitments to meet the demands of the E.U. regulator and abandons the Refinitiv deal, they could swiftly turn around and look for the legal remedies they have included in the Borsa Italiana sale agreement to walk away from the transaction. ', '', 'Further, other remedies to meet E.U. regulators’ demands may also be successful. If measures less severe than the sale of Borsa Italiana suffice, LSE may look for options to walk away from the deal. Recent threats by LVMH to walk away in their agreed deal to purchase Tiffany’s illustrate the extent to which deals that have already been agreed to can still be amended. LSE could potentially use better circumstances in their negotiations with regulators to keep a hold of the valuable Borsa Italiana asset. ', '', 'As part of the agreement, both companies LSE and Euronext had to gain shareholder approval of the deal. Results at LSE’s general meeting overwhelmingly supported the deal; 291,694,564 votes for and only 4,193 submitted against. This is likely due to the appeal of the Refinitiv transaction, which is contingent on this sale.

', '', 'Cloud Gaming 3-Phase Transmission', '', 'The transition to cloud gaming is occurring in real-time and is part of the 2 phases of gaming; digitalisation of gaming and cloud gaming transmission. Both transitions can be explained by explaining the changes in the customer journey and the hardware.', '', 'Firstly, came physical to digital media. This is due to 2 main points. Firstly, the changes in the customer journey of selecting a game from buying a physical disc from a store to downloading a game from the relevant virtual store. Secondly, came the changes in hardware to make them either physical and digital or digital solely compatible, thus pushing legacy gamers away from solely relying on physical game media. This is shown in Figure 2, with the movement from the Xbox 360 to the Xbox One series, with the Xbox One S being digital only. Currently, gaming is transitioning into cloud gaming. The change in the customer journey goes hand in hand with the change in hardware requirements. Often, gamers could only play games limited by the capacity of their own console/PC. With cloud gaming, any hardware shortfalls are eliminated as one essentially plays the game by streaming the outputs onto their device whilst simultaneously streaming back the game inputs to a data centre server. ', '', 'What this now means is that gamers can choose any game of their choosing in the knowledge that they now have the capacity to do so. Now with software innovations such as Xbox Game Pass and Playstation Now, gamers can purchase games and then stream the gaming experience onto their device. This has resulted in massive changes for the fourth generation of Xbox. The digital only console, Xbox Series S, is significantly smaller than the dual media Xbox Series X due to reduced levels of hardware. The Xbox Series S is designed specifically for cloud gaming as hardware is no longer a consideration and the lower cost of the console starts to push gamers towards this new model of gaming', '', 'Continued Growth in Cloud Gaming', '', 'The growth in the global cloud gaming is an upside for this acquisition. By removing the requirement for hardware, cloud gaming allows users to play on smart devices with high-speech Internet. Cloud gaming also lifts barriers for cost-conscious consumers, thereby attracting casual gamers into the market. Grand View Research reports that the cloud gaming market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 47.9% from 2020 to 2027. North America is expected to see the strongest growth in that period due to higher R&D investment in cloud computing, more widespread adoption of smartphones, and the presence of high-speed Internet. Asia, too, will see a significant growth in the coming decade due to a massive untapped gaming population and the recent penetration of smartphones. ', '', 'The rise of 5G in developed countries like the US and South Korea is expected to contribute to this growth, as mobile gaming has been limited thus far to low-spec games. Consumer bandwidth has been an impediment for streaming services and game operators alike, so the recent spread of 5G will revolutionize connectivity at users’ homes and maximize the potential of cloud gaming. 5G’s higher speeds and lower latencies are truly a game changer for cloud gaming, as they will enable mobile devices to support more complex games and accelerate the transition away from casual low-spec games. In fact, a recent poll from the Mobile Video Industry Council found that anywhere between 25 to 50% of 5G data traffic will come from cloud gaming by 2022. Operators like Playgiga and Hatch are already forming partnerships with cloud-gaming providers like AT&T and Sprint. Overall, the growth in cloud gaming and 5G will only complement Microsoft’s shift from a device-centric strategy towards a player-centric one.

There has been a trend of consolidation within the gaming industry particularly when considering cloud gaming and creative studios. Microsoft itself has a long history of acquiring creative studios to create content to suit their hardware whether that be Xbox One or Windows 10 PC gaming. For instance, Microsoft acquired Lionhead Studios to develop Fable Legends to suit their desires. Firstly, Lionhead optimised the game for Xbox One, then for DirectX12 graphics for Windows 10 PC gamers and then Xbox One and Windows 10 Crossplay capabilities. Larger companies want to differentiate themselves with their game offerings by utilizing the creative talents of indie and smaller game developers (to attract prospective gamers) while also ensuring the content is compatible and promotes their own existing software and hardware.

Unlike other competitors, Apple Arcade does not require users to purchase individual games after they subscribed, which is like Netflix’s “one price for all” business model. However, Apple has a limited number of games and tends to not include console games. With a 46% smartphone market share in the United States and 13.5% globally, Apple’s addressable market is limited to Apple users, therefore the network effect may not be as profound as other competitors.', '', 'Potential Entry - Facebook ', '', 'Facebook Gaming has launched in 2017, it serves Discord and Twitch as a streaming platform for gamers to stream their plays on PC. However, outside of streaming itself, Facebook has dedicated a lot of effort into Oculus’ Virtual Reality (VR) gaming development. Even though Facebook does not own any data centres that would support cloud gaming logistically, Facebook’s leading edge VR development could pose threats to Microsoft if VR gaming continues to cannibalize cloud or digital gaming segments.', '', 'Conclusion', '', 'Despite the cloud gaming space requiring significant barriers to entry, it has attracted most big technology companies to compete in the space because of its explosive growth opportunities in platform growth, traffic exposure and income opportunities.

Although the deal is classified as a merger, it is essentially a takeover of Bankia by CaixaBank – they are 3x greater in market value and 2x as large in assets. As a result, other Spanish banks are growing keen on buying or joining rival banks to explore strategic options and be in a stronger position for cross-border deals. The merger also allows for CaixaBank to make significant annual cost cuts, resulting in increased revenue of about 1.1 billion (EUR). Together, the consolidated Spanish bank is expected to generate approximately 770 million (EUR) in cost synergies and within the next five years and is projected to reach an estimated annual revenue of 290 million (EUR).', ' ', 'The short-term consequences of the CaixaBank takeover are significant; there are a considerable number of job shutdowns and closing branches that come with the synergy. The main trade union Workers’ Commission (CCOO) has estimated over 51,000 staff to lose employment and approximately 6,300 branches to close in Spain. ', ' ', 'On the other hand, with the profitability of Spanish banks at risk due to low interest rates, subdued credit demand, and increased regulatory costs, the merger has allowed for CaixaBank to dramatically reduce overcapacity and increase profits. CaixaBank, with connections deep throughout a thriving Catalonia, will be able to broaden their presence into the nation’s large consumer and economic structure. In doing so, the Spanish banks will be able to cut off punitive competition and recover from their slowly diminishing profitability.', ' ', '“With this operation, we will form the principal Spanish franchise at a moment when it’s more necessary than ever to create entities with a critical size,” ', 'Goirigolzarri (Current President of Bankia)', '', '', 'Long-term consequences', '', 'This acquisition projects to be the beginning of what has been denominated “a new era in the Spanish banking sector”, as the Spanish banking industry looks to quickly consolidate in order to mitigate the adverse effects of the coronavirus pandemic. This, in fact, has been the decisive factor behind this merger, which was once before proposed in 2012 albeit with an unsuccessful outcome (the situation for the banks then was not as dire as the current one, with analysts describing the rationale behind this deal as a “question of survival”).', '', 'Amongst an agonizing Spanish economy, other banks will be looking to swiftly follow CaixaBank and Bankia’s footsteps. Rumours include Santander acquiring Bankinter or a BBVA merger with Banco Sabadell, as these entities hope to remain on top of their competition (before the merger, BBVA and Santander ranked first and second respectively amongst Spanish financial institutions, with both now trailing the post-merger CaixaBank in terms of assets and market share). Altogether these banks already comprise 72.4% of all financial assets held nationally, with these figures only looking to increase as the industry consolidates further.', '', 'Experts in fact consider larger national banks acquiring smaller entities to be but the onset of an increasing trend, and one that could expand well beyond international frontiers; with Spanish banks merging with those from other European nations such as Italy (where the sector is highly fragmented), France or Germany (where banks are facing similar profitability issues). Many believe this will lead to a wave of mergers that will leave behind a highly concentrated future banking sector; namely a “handful of big players”. These larger institutions would be better equipped to deal with the pressures of increasing delinquency, negative interest rates or the threats posed by fintech.', '', '', 'Risks and uncertainties', '', 'Barring any unforeseen issues, the merger should go ahead as planned and be completed by Q1 2021. Both institutions’ boards have approved of this deal, which is now only waiting to be sanctioned by the “Ministerio de Asuntos Económicos” and “Comisión Nacional de Los Mercados y la Competencia”. The presence of left-wing populist party “Podemos” in the governing coalition has given rise to rumours that they could resist the deal, but no real opposition is expected as the case for an oligopoly between CaixaBank and the other 4 big Spanish banks has already been debunked (the flow and rates of credit are not projected to be altered as a result of this or any future mergers, and they are in fact expected to become more competitive).', '', 'Instead, the main issue facing this merger at this stage (albeit not significant) will be the backlash at the prospective loss of employment; 30%-40% of Bankia’s offices expect to be closed, and 5,000-15,000 jobs are to be cut as a result of redundancies. The headquarters, however, will remain unchanged as both banks are based in the city of Valencia; CaixaBank moved its offices from Barcelona to Valencia following the civil unrest that gripped the city in 2017, as the massive protests for independence after an illegal referendum turned violent. Nonetheless, CaixaBank still retains significant influence in the Catalonia region; this alone should make the new entity into a Spanish banking powerhouse, ready to “rub shoulders with the largest European financial institutions”.', '', 'Another hot topic of debate around this merger has been how the Spanish government itself stands to benefit from this deal. This is because in 2012 the Spanish government bailed out Bankia as part of a €40 billion rescue package for the Spanish financial industry. This left them with a 60% stake in Bankia, (since then increased to 61.8%), a bank that had missed 3 straight deadlines (and by all means looking to miss a 4th one this January 2021) to take the company private and return the taxpayers’ money. Although in all likelihood this recouping of taxpayers’ funds still won’t take place after the merger, Luis de Guindos (ECB vice-president) has repeatedly defended bailing out Bankia, warning the “alternative would have been significantly more costly” and expressing hope that the merger might improve the situation. Moreover, after the merger, the State will see its stake diluted to a much more digestible 15% of a bank that looks to be more profitable than the weakened stand-alone Bankia. Consequently, the ECB and Banco de España have collectively voiced their approval of this deal, as the ECB actively encourages further consolidation of the European banking industry. This process is expected to take place “by stages”, with this merger seemingly being the first one.', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Oct 23, 2020', '6 min read', 'Sunrun acquires Vivint in all stock transaction valued at  $3.2 billion ', 'Sunrun acquires Vivint in all stock transaction valued at  $3.2 billion ', 'By Vadim Mandel (London School of Economics) ', 'By Vadim Mandel (London School of Economics) ', '', '', 'Overview of the Deal\xa0', 'Overview of the Deal\xa0', '', 'Sunrun (NYSE: RUN), America’s biggest rooftop- solar company has announced that it will be taking over rival Vivint Solar (VSLR) for $3.2bn in an all-stock transaction in one of the biggest deals in industry history expected to close in the 4th\xa0 quarter, pursuant to which each share of Vivint Solar common stock will be exchanged for 0.55 shares of Sunrun common stock, representing a combined\xa0 Enterprise Value of $9.2 billion.\xa0', 'Sunrun (NYSE: RUN), America’s biggest rooftop- solar company has announced', 'that it will be taking over rival Vivint Solar (VSLR) for $3.2bn in an ', 'transaction in one of the biggest deals in industry history expected to close in the 4th\xa0 quarter, pursuant to which each share of Vivint Solar common stock will be', 'exchanged for 0.55 shares of Sunrun common stock, representing a combined\xa0 Enterprise Value of $9.2 billion.\xa0', '', 'Vivint Solar stockholders are expected to own approximately 36% and Sunrun stockholders are expected to own approximately 64% of the fully diluted shares of the combined company.
