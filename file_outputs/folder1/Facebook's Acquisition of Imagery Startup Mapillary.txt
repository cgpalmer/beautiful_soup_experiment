On the other hand, the three billion miles of street imagery from Mapillary could highly complement Oculus’ VR development. It further enables Facebook to create real-world scenarios in VR/AR settings, where no other competitors have come close in terms of the level of expertise and data collections. VR games or enterprise solutions like Grand Theft Auto or training software will be made possible with both Oculus and Mapillary’s technology.

The acquisition could also have a humanitarian bend, as Facebook has been providing nonprofits and humanitarian agencies with its Marketplace location datasets. Facebook has already been using its location density and network coverage maps to inform disaster relief efforts; Mapillary’s data will only improve FB Marketplace’s capabilities in that space.

Competitive Behavior (Google & the Rest of Tech Companies) 
Competitive Behavior (Google & the Rest of Tech Companies) 
 
According to Statista, Google occupies over 92.5% of the search engine market and over 70% of the consumer mapping market followed by Waze (10%) and Apple Map (9%). The reason Google has been so successful in these markets is that they commoditized their services, which has made it difficult for other players to break-in without capital and secondary platform support.

Despite Google’s significant position in its consumer mapping business, they do not invest or pay as much attention to Google Maps than to their other businesses, such as cloud services Google Cloud, autonomous technology Waymo, and content platform Youtube. Facebook’s entry will strengthen the competition in the consumer mapping space which will drive competition between the two, as a result improving overall quality to end-consumers.

For the rest of tech companies, as the street imagery industry becomes more proficient and mature, it will be extremely hard for companies to break into the industry. The barriers to entry will significantly increase as Facebook incorporates its street imagery technology in VR/AR and consumer mapping functions. The third company with the level of capital and interest in expanding to the imagery industry is Amazon.  Amazon has previously partnered up with Mapillary to co-develop solutions for Amazon’s workers to logistically navigate shipping addresses and warehouses. However, the question Amazon needs to address is whether Street Imagery is a better opportunity to invest in compared to its alternatives, its current technology is built for Amazon delivery workers only.

Revenue and Cost Synergies 
Revenue and Cost Synergies 
 
While Facebook will incur more costs with no new revenue initially, Mapillary will directly contribute to Facebook’s mission of creating a more connected world. Facebook will leverage Mapilllary’s mapping capabilities to improve their location density maps, movement maps, and network coverage maps, which are used primarily to provide real-time information for disaster-struck areas. Facebook extending Mapillary for commercial purposes will challenge Google Maps’ monopoly and provides an opportunity for increased ad revenue from commercial businesses. Mapillary will also be implemented into Facebook Marketplace to better connect local consumers, which will allow Facebook to charge fees for sellers to boost their listings. Overall, this acquisition provides Facebook with the means to challenge Google’s monopoly over digital mapping.

This acquisition poses a major threat to Google’s control over the digital mapping industry. Facebook’s opening Mapillary for commercial purposes follows the trend of integrating social media and augmented reality into mapping platforms. Facebook looks to compete with Google, who integrated Yelp into Google Maps, by showing trending restaurants on their maps. Commercial use of Mapillary will allow for increased ad revenue as restaurants will be able to pay to boost their position on a trending list. The implementation of Mapillary on Facebook’s augmented reality will rival Google’s AR directions. Facebook looks to further gain a competitive edge in advanced mapping by combining Mapillary with Facebook’s advanced machine learning to provide robotic and logistic solutions, such as predicting traffic patterns. In conclusion, Facebook’s acquisition of Mapillary provides an opportunity for advanced mapping and AR capabilities for next-generation technology challenging the existing digital mapping industry.

Facebook’s acquisition experience 
Facebook’s acquisition experience 
 
Facebook has acquired over 80 companies since its inception, of which many are arguably some of the most successful acquisitions in the industry. Thus, the company’s experience in integrating various firms, should be beneficial in the acquisition of Mapillary. Although the vast majority of Facebook’s acquisitions have been businesses based in the United States, the corporate culture of this Swedish start-up should not be too foreign, so should not impede the successful integration of the company.

Facebook has faced rising antitrust concerns 
Facebook has faced rising antitrust concerns 
 
Big tech companies such as Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Apple have become increasingly targeted by regulators over antitrust concerns. For instance, in recent months the FTC has investigated Facebook’s acquisition of Instagram and Whatsapp, with some sources saying this may result in a lawsuit against Facebook. While growing regulatory issues may pose a threat to Facebook’s acquisition of Mapillary, there are two main reasons to believe that this will not be the case. Firstly, Facebook itself has recently backed out of acquisition where it feared antitrust issues. For instance, in 2019 Facebook itself abandoned plans to acquire Houseparty over fears of antitrust issues. This signals that Facebook is increasing its scrutiny when evaluating acquisition options, so the company acquiring Mapillary despite ongoing regulatory challenges reflects that Facebook believes regulatory concerns should not be an issue in this acquisition. Secondly, as EU regulators are typically stricter than US regulators, Mapillary increasing its operations in North America again decreases the regulatory risk involved in this deal.

On July 29, 2020, the US Congress has invited the CEOs from Big Tech including Facebook, whereas congressman has made claims about “No one, let alone a foreign company (Referring to Facebook), can be allowed to interfere in our nation’s affairs. They must be investigated immediately and when found guilty, punished”. Regulations on technology companies have been a controversial topic for public regulators, Facebook and Google were encountering enormous public sentiments onto their data collection system, which were closely tied to their operating advertising business model.

The street imagery industry has been faced with rising scrutiny by regulators, particularly driven by privacy concerns. For instance, Google has been faced with multiple lawsuits over its Street View platform. While Mapillary has made efforts to automatically blur personal information such as faces and license plates, this technology is still prone to mistakes. As the street imagery industry continues to grow, Facebook can expect that regulation of the industry will only continue to increase. Therefore, as Facebook’s exposure to this industry will rise considerably with the acquisition of Mapillary, the company will have to expend resources on ensuring it complies with evolving street imagery regulations.
