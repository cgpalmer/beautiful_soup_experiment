In the food delivery industry, M&A activity and valuations have been at very high levels over the past years. There are three main aspects of the market that make companies attractive investments - the industry’s growth that offers upside potential, the technology-based business models that open doors for different opportunities in the future and the fierce competition that incentivises consolidation. An example of the trend’s implications can be the German food delivery market. In 2017, the main players were Lieferando, Delivery Hero, Deliveroo and Foodora. By 2019, there was only one choice left, being Lieferando.

Trend Drivers 
 
There are different reasons for the M&A that firms engage in. 
There are different reasons for the M&A that firms engage in. 
Firstly, M&A in this sector is strong because companies are an attractive investment due to the market’s strong growth. The industry is of course still new and up-and-coming and some investors see it as a “once in a generation shift in consumers´ eating habits” which implies an unsaturated market and a large upside potential. Frost & Sullivan, for example, assumed that the industry size would more than double between 2018 and 2025. As a result, M&A activity in this sector has been strong over the past years.

Secondly, many of these companies are also attractive investments because of their technology-reliant marketplace business models. Marketplace businesses such as Just Eat, Takeaway.com or Grubhub rely on restaurants to deliver to customers, thus not employing costly in-house delivery services like Deliveroo or Uber Eats. This technology-reliance has resultantly improved the prospects of these companies and has even more upside when investors consider the potential enhancements in service quality that can be driven using consumer’s data.

Lastly, there is a lot of consolidation in the sector that is to a large part driven by what Takeaway.com chief executive Jitse Groen called “unprecedented competition”. There are virtually no switching costs for customers and with an identical set of restaurants that one can order from, competition for market share can be fierce. “We at Takeaway.com have witnessed the competitiveness of this industry” said Mr Groen, “as many of our competitors have gone bankrupt. This is an inherently difficult industry that requires a thorough understanding of how to make money.” Even Amazon shut down its food delivery platform Amazon Restaurants in the US and UK. Scale in this industry is thus of utmost importance which encourages companies to engage in M&A. “The problem you face with delivery is ensuring that you gain enough drops per hour to establish profitability. By opening it up to groceries, or non-takeaway food, you may gain more orders, but these may not overlap, which will just add extra costs,” said James Lockyer, an analyst at Peel Hunt.

Nowadays, the trust in apps and the reliance on them is high. The user experience has improved and consumers feel increasingly comfortable in the data-security that apps can achieve. At the same time, the level of the technology – in the form of for example payment options – has also improved, thus making the usage of such systems more efficient.

Key M&A Example 
Key M&A Example 
 
Just Eat plc. is an online food delivery service coming out of the UK that operates in the majority of Europe, Australia, Canada and parts of South America. In July last year, it published the composition of an all-stock merger with its Dutch counterpart Takeaway.com. Four months later, the international deal-making and e-commerce arm of the internet giant Naspers announced an unsolicited cash offer for Just Eat. Following a small bidding competition, Takeaway.com won shareholder approval for the takeover in January, valuing Just Eat at $8.24 bn which corresponds to a 8.7x Sales Multiple and 61.5x EBIT multiple. With a premium of 44%, the implied multiples for a 0% premium transaction are 6.0x and 42.7x respectively which indicates the high valuation levels in this industry. Correspondingly, this transaction is a good depiction of the ongoing trend in this sector that leads companies to compete intensely for new market share, resulting in M&A activity.
