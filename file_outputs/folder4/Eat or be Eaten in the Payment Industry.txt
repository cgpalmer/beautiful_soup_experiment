Trend Summary  
Trend Summary  
 
In the last 10 years, the market environment has changed and apart from banking players such as Barclaycard, Crédit Agricole and Credit Mutuel, comparatively new firms such as Worldpay, Worldline, SIA, Ingenico, Adyen, and Wirecard have grown substantially. Payment solution providers like mobile wallets and processor firms are all beneficiaries of digitalization, with payment volumes being on the rise due to the structural shift away from cash. In recent years, we have seen many companies from this sector consolidating intensively with most acquisitions being undertaken in the search for innovation and broadening of the product offerings to foster growth. In general, there are two underlying drivers for this phenomenon. Firstly, interchange regulations and rising competition are leading to greater pressure on margins. Secondly, the dynamics inside the industry are changing with small niches becoming extremely important for traditional players. In this framework, consolidation seems the only way for companies to grow and survive in such a fragmented industry.

Trend Overview  
Trend Overview  
 
The payment industry is changing. With new customers whose needs are difficult to meet, higher threat of new entrants and offerings for traditional products eroding in profitability, consolidation seems the only way for companies to build capabilities, overcome the slowdown of their original product offering and retain their competitive position.  
The payment industry is changing. With new customers whose needs are difficult to meet, higher threat of new entrants and offerings for traditional products eroding in profitability, consolidation seems the only way for companies to build capabilities, overcome the slowdown of their original product offering and retain their competitive position.  
 
Firstly, accelerated growth in non-traditional sectors is leading to a surge of M&A activity. There are specific B2C and B2B industries that are growing rapidly. The sectors with the highest growth are B2C e-commerce with an expected CAGR of over 15% throughout the next 4 years and marketplace payouts to SMEs for B2B, at a CAGR of roughly 10%. The demand for increasingly sophisticated payment solutions coming from this field is rising; so is the number of new providers entering the market to address the corresponding pain points. As these sectors tend to be outside of the traditional player’s established base, companies turn to M&A to acquire capabilities and to optimize operating leverage through economies of scale.

Secondly, M&A activity is high because of the rising interest in non-traditional companies and the need of firms to position themselves well. Working in such a fragmented industry with a rising number of entrants, leads to a sectoral increase in payment solutions, which are at first combined from different suppliers to build a company's infrastructure. As a result, customers -- small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) -- have an increasing demand for affordable solutions that streamline their processes across the entire firm. This happens because an omnichannel approach to payments works better with today’s shopping behaviours.

As SMEs experience a rapid increase in cash flows over electronic payments and tend to pay more for the products per transaction, they will move closer the focal point of payment solution providers’ attention.

In addition, providing services to the large customers has become increasingly commoditized. This in turn has increased M&A activity. Niches in this industry can yield above average returns. Consolidation enables companies to offer not only one solution to these companies but several solutions. M&A activity is, thus, playing out with the goal of improving the customer proposition, facilitating access to multiple technologies and building scale as companies are trying to conquer the industry.

In the payment industry, consolidation is led by two main drivers: tightened interchange regulations and rising competition, and structural changes inside the industry.  
In the payment industry, consolidation is led by two main drivers: tightened interchange regulations and rising competition, and structural changes inside the industry.  
 
The need for scale and cost efficiency has become more acute as both interchange regulation and rising competitive pressure have restricted companies’ ability to use prices as a means for revenue management. Focus has therefore shifted to the costs side: as the payment industry is a scale business by nature, more and more firms are aiming to spread their fixed costs over an increasing volume base.

Regulation on interchange fees -- fees that a merchant bank needs to pay each time a customer purchases something -- ensures that these fees are capped at a specific level such that the average costs incurred by the retailer during a cash transaction do not exceed the cost incurred during a credit card transaction.

The introduction of a series of tightened regulations such as the EU MIF Regulation has significantly limited a  processor's ability to earn money from transaction-based fees. s processing higher volumes on fixed costs allows the providers to offset this pressure, scale has become vital.

Furthermore, the increasing competitive pressure from new niche-market players and industry crossovers is pushing down margins, in two different ways.  
Furthermore, the increasing competitive pressure from new niche-market players and industry crossovers is pushing down margins, in two different ways.  
 
Firstly, the blurring of lines between different payment types, a phenomenon caused by the continuous transformation of the payment industry and the leverage of non-traditional business models by the players in the industry, gives way to bold entry moves by non-bank players. With such changing dynamics, competition is rising, exerting pressure on margins.

Secondly, the changing trust relationship in the industry is reducing the barriers to entry.  Back in the day, new entrants had to work hard on creating superior customer experience to lead customers away from their originally trusted partners. Recently, different surveys indicated that this advantage is eroding as consumers have become more comfortable with entrusting their financial information to new non-bank business models. This clearly lowers barriers to entry for new non-bank players, while raising the bar for the incumbent ones.

In addition, big tech are entering the industry as well.  With Apple introducing Apple Pay, Amazon offering a wide range of financial services -- Amazon Lending, Amazon Cash, Amazon Pay and Amazon Reload--Facebook having Libra and Google using Google Pay, the threat of incumbents in the payment industry is significantly rising. Moreover, the fact Asian players such as WeChat and Alibaba are also on the run, further exacerbates it.

Given the aforementioned trends, it seems clear that consolidation is a natural tactic to protect and expand their businesses as well as to acquire new customers. Unless firms engage in such relevant tactics, they may sooner or later go bankrupt or get eaten by larger players in the market. Scale is thus vital.

Further Trend Analysis  
Further Trend Analysis  
 
The ongoing consolidation trend is likely to further blur the lines of the payments value chain,  a move that may be necessary to offer clients a fully integrated product. A prime example of this development is represented by the $26 billion merger between TSYS and Global Payments, with a greater focus on merchants. Worldline and Ingenico represent another important example. The two companies have strengths in different part of the value chain: Worldline is a leader in payments software, while Ingenico specialises in merchant hardware and online transactions (as we can see from the graph below).

There are still many companies that have a lot to gain from a broader product portfolio as well as additional scale and whose capabilities and value chain positions may be more efficient elsewhere.

The underlying drivers behind the shift from cash to digital payments, the scale generating growth and the rapid expansion of the SME sector are considered to be secular and for the most part self-sustaining. The pressure to consolidate may be felt most strongly by incumbent players that have not yet participated in strategic partnerships; only time will tell whether their stand-alone strategy will become a sustainable source of differentiation --for example, through a more agile customer orientation -- or a limitation in terms of scale and reach. Regardless of the outcome, such specialized companies are likely to be seen as attractive targets in the coming years. As a consequence, there will be more deals coming, especially in Europe, where the industry is extremely fragmented.

Moreover, cross-border transactions will become increasingly common, with Asia Pacific Region having the strongest forecasted growth. Acquiring competitors overseas provide companies with a beachhead in new and unknown markets: they get access to new customers and capabilities and can fully exploit economies of scale. The $12 billion acquisition of UK based Worldpay by US American Vantiv is just an example of such deals.
