We first the direction of the sector and industry NIO belongs to. The aim is to check if the stock’s movements are determined by a common sentiment for the sector and industry, or if the stock’s movements are specific to the stock itself, in which case, the stock will be susceptible to rapid trend changes. We believe the stock has more trending strength if it is moving in the same direction of the competitors.

As we can see in the upper pictures, the last 6 months have been particularly bullish for every sector. In particular, we want to zoom in the performance of the consumer discretionary sector, which is the one where NIO lies. Its performances in the three-time ranges in consideration have been +24.6%, +8.09%, and +2.67%. We can conclude that this sector was mostly aligned with the general market conditions without positioning itself neither in the top performing, nor in the worst performing. Let’s have a look at this chart:

In the upper chart we plotted the S&P 500 consumer discretionary index, which we believe to be a significant indicator of how the sector is doing worldwide. The stock trended upwards for the entire summer, but had a correction with the beginning of September that lasted until almost the end of the month. After that, the stock rose again, but found some resistance at 1300.00. After hitting that level, the price bounced downwards at 1162.38 on 2nd November. From that point, the price began a shy uptrend, which we can see from the price being over the 50 days Moving Average. Right now, the price seems to be headed upwards, but the signals are not strong enough.

Now, let’s have a look at which industries are pushing the price higher, and which are pushing it lower, in order to separate once again the winners from the losers and see where NIO’s industry, which is vehicles manufacturers, lies. We think that every time an index doesn’t show strong signals in either direction, looking at the industries inside the sector is even more valuable. Particularly, we want to see if there are opposing trending industries that try to move the sector in two different directions simultaneously, or if all of them are achieving neutral or soft returns.

We have used the Independent Power and Renewable Electricity Producers and Automobile industries as proxies for Electric Vehicles and have compared this to the broader Energy sector to determine how are these industries performing relative to it. 
We have used the Independent Power and Renewable Electricity Producers and Automobile industries as proxies for Electric Vehicles and have compared this to the broader Energy sector to determine how are these industries performing relative to it. 
 
As Figure 5 shows, the Energy sector has performed the worst out of all the indicators that we have chosen. It has fallen by 38% over the year and has not recovered from the COVID-19 crash in March that saw markets worldwide plummet. However, the Renewable Energy industry is driving growth in the Energy sector, having grown by 17% in the past year. Renewable Energy and Automobiles, as shown by the yellow and dark blue lines, have been following the S&P 500 Index through its boom and bust phases over the past year. This is expected, as COVID-19 forced factories to shut and global demand to drop. As demand is now growing, we expect these industries to track the market. Furthermore, due to the growth seen in renewables (as shown in previous reports), we believe Renewable Energy to possibly beat the market over the coming years.

However, it is important to consider what particular companies are driving the growth in Automobiles and Renewable Energy to recognise how the performance of these industries will be reflected in NIO’s stock performance.

craft.co 
 as of 30/12/2020) 
 
Tesla is currently NIO’s biggest competitor in terms of valuation, market capitalisation, and hype. As shown in Figure 6, Tesla’s growth over the past year has been the most dominant out of all Electric Vehicle companies. We attribute this to Tesla being the pioneer of innovating and remarketing the Electric Vehicle space. NIO cannot lay claim to either, making the comparison between NIO and Tesla unfair for forecasting NIO’s growth. However, despite Tesla dominating the Electric Vehicle scene in China, several domestic competitors are rising up.

China is currently the world’s biggest EV market and has set the target that by 2025, over 20% of auto sales must be Electric Vehicles. As a result, fellow Chinese Electric Vehicle companies such as Geely Automobile, XPeng, and Li Auto are primed for rapid growth. Currently, NIO has a debt to capital ratio of 5.96 against the industry average of 0.29 and is not vertically integrated unlike competitors such as XPeng. If NIO does not reformulate its supply chains in the near future, it could potentially miss out on growth in China’s Electric Vehicle space.

However, we will conclude this section by stating that NIO is currently following industry and sector trends from a macro perspective. Once NIO begins to improve on its fundamentals, we will be more confident of its position as a market leader.

Momentum refers to the velocity or the price change in a security’s price. It is meant to show the rate of change in the price movement over a specific period of time highlighting the strength of the trend. Resultantly, NIO’s momentum statistics seem to suggest that while the short term momentum is slightly lagged, the medium to long term momentum for the equity is still intact. In fact, on comparing the 1M vs 3M momentum numbers, we conclude that the medium to long term momentum embedded in the stock has capacity enough to drive the share.

Nonetheless, we believe that the short term laggedness is partially because of the exponential growth, the equity price of NIO has witnessed over the past three to four months because of which it is being followed by a period of consolidation because of which buying on dip and selling would be the best strategy to employ to scalp profits.

As on 25th December 2020, NIO’s share price closed at  $45.77. While the stock witnessed quite a muted growth trajectory at the tip of the pandemic crash as well as a few months after, the share price surged between the beginning and mid-November. Nonetheless, the share price stood the test of time and corrected by approximately 30%, part of which we believe can be best explained using tools of Technical Analysis. We believe that this momentous drive in sentiment may be attributed to a number of fundamental catalysts at play, including the better than expected November delivery numbers, and the additional investment the company attracted from the provincial governments of Hefei and Anhaui, worth 7 billion Chinese Yuan.

Currently, we believe that the immediate support and resistance levels for NIO’s stock are $44.17 and $50.00 respectively. Furthermore we believe that some of the other crucial levels other than the immediate support and resistance are $54.38 on the upside and $42.09 and $38.8 on the downside. In fact the strength of these levels is further complemented by plotting the Fibonacci Levels for the stock, on an upward basis. We observe that indeed 44.7 and 49.3 are the 0.786 and 0.5 retracement levels respectively that the $40 level has been a crucial level since 15th November (part of which we think is to do with the round number psychology).

Having bottomed out due to the pandemic in March, the stock entered a parallel channel characterised by a strong support of 2.30 and resistance of 3.82 (as highlighted by blue lines in Graph 13), however this was broken in early June by bullish sentiment, reflected through the formation of three white soldiers from 1-3 June (as highlighted by the purple box in Graph 13). A month later, the stock price demonstrated another large gap up on 1 July 2020, shown by a consecutive bullish spinning top and bullish hammer (as highlighted by the orange box in Graph 13), with the stock then entering a rising channel between July and November. This channel was characterised by a higher-high higher-low formation across the four-month period and although there were some corrections, this trendline was not broken until November.

Following the doji candlestick on 4 November, there was another large gap up, which echoed the bullish sentiment present in the market, which saw the stock price rise from 35.32 to 42.39 over the course of one day. Since this movement, the price action of the stock entered a parallel channel within which the stock has been somewhat volatile, demonstrating both higher-high higher-low formations (as in early November) as well as lower-high lower-low formations (as in early December). This parallel channel has been characterized by a strong support of 40.00 and a resistance of 48.38, although this resistance was broken on 21 December and quickly corrected.

In December, the stock has seen a mostly bullish sentiment, likely due to the positive outlook from consumers approaching Christmas. This can be seen in the three white soldiers trend, following the morning star pattern between 13th and 15th December (as highlighted in blue in Graph 14), which saw the stock price rise from 40.00 to 48.96. Going forward, however, with uncertainty in the global markets following the Brexit trade deal and COVID-19 cases rising, the stock could witness a bearish trend. The dark cloud cover displayed on 22nd December indicates a potentially bearish outlook for the future. This is further shown by the 3 black crows pattern formed, following the dark cloud cover (as highlighted in orange in Graph 14), with the stock price dropping from 49.67 on 22nd December to closing at 45.77 at the end of 24th December. One can anticipate that the stock price will likely remain in the parallel channel that it has stayed in over the last few months, because of which we advise a buy on the dip, sell on rise strategy.  
In December, the stock has seen a mostly bullish sentiment, likely due to the positive outlook from consumers approaching Christmas. This can be seen in the three white soldiers trend, following the morning star pattern between 13th and 15th December (as highlighted in blue in Graph 14), which saw the stock price rise from 40.00 to 48.96.

Once again, we use Moving Average analysis to spot the trend of a stock, as well as the potential entry and exit points. Here, we use three Exponential Moving Averages of length 9, 21, and 55 days. We consider the stock to have a negative outlook when the 9 days Exponential Moving Average is under the 21 days Exponential Moving Average, which is itself under the long term EMA. Conversely, we consider the stock to have a bullish outlook when the opposite appears, i.e. 9 days over 21 days, altogether over 55 days. The first scenario is what we are seeing as of the 30th of December when looking at NIO’s chart. However, the situation is not as clear as we would like it to be; in fact, the fast EMA. and the medium term EMA crossed themselves on multiple occasions during the last couple of weeks, resulting in the price entering a phase of consolidation.  Since these two EMAs are still very close to each other, we can’t pronounce ourselves in favor of any short- or medium-term future direction of the price.

As for the MACD, the red oscillator confirms what we have just said. The difference between the fast Moving Average and the slow Moving Average, as we can see in the upper chart, is almost nonexistent, resulting in a situation that doesn’t give a clue for either direction. We believe it’s best to wait for further price developments.

The Bollinger Band analysis for NIO seems to indicate a phase of minor consolidation after the rally. As seen in Graph 16, the price action has been extremely sticky to the 20dMA and has been embedded within the +(-) 2 SD bounds of the Bollinger Band. Additionally, we observe that both the upper (as shown by the horizontal blue line), as well as the lower bound, have been acting as a straight resistance and support respectively. Hence, we conclude that unless these bounds are convincingly broken and the price action dismantles the ‘squeeze’ - minor movements within the band are likely to continue because of which traders could employ a buy on the dip, sell on rise strategy.

We would like to end this report with a note on some crucial observations from the movement witnessed in the RSI and Stochastic Oscillator for NIO. In terms of the RSI, we observe that the 56.6 level has taken the form of a support-turn resistance. Furthermore, we observe that the extensive selling pressure at the start of December coincided with a negative divergence in the RSI.

As far as the movements in the Stochastic Oscillator are concerned, we first observe that there were clear signals of the share price movement to have been extended as the Oscillator continued to hover in the overbought zone. Most recently, we witness that it has tested the overbought threshold and deflected, thereby signaling a brief moment of correction of muted movement in the share price. Nonetheless, we expect that till the Oscillator remains in the neutral zone, that would be fertile ground for the stock to attract a move on the upside within the parallel channel as highlighted earlier.
